This, and the natural propensity of the kuah-lij for order, resulted in a society that had remained fresh and vigorous for over 10,000 years.","Kuah-lij young are placed into a public cr\u00e8che to be raised within days of birth, to be raised by child care specialists. As they grow and are educated, their affinities and talents are assessed, and at age 15 they are assigned a vocation, based on their talents, and an avocation, based on their preferences. They then study more intensely in these two areas, until they reach maturity at age 25. Kuah-lij youths have the option of changing vocation or avocation if they insist upon it, though this almost never occurs.","Upon reaching maturity, they fully enter society, where they spend 10 months of the year working at their vocation 10 hours per day, and the final two months on sabbatical, traveling, exploring, or doing whatever else strikes them as interesting. Their culture is based on a complex system of credit, with currency reserved only for dealing with non-kuahlij, and medicine, vacation time, and other services are all socialized, but due to their innately organized, cooperative mindset, there is remarkably little corruption within their culture.","The kuah-lij had civilized their planet millennia ago, and had settlements across its lands and beneath its seas. Many areas they deliberately kept undeveloped, and they took great pleasure in long sea voyages and extended exploration of back country.","Their innate tendency to organized society also helped them immeasurably with mass production and technology, in particular a merging of science and magic. Though it never reached the pinnacles seen in other exotic cross-planar cultures, it was highly polished, with many of their technological marvels being as much works of art as useful items.","This idyllic existence came to an end over 300 years ago, when a strange darkness crept into the deepest places of their oceans. Kuah-lij explorers that investigated did not return, or came back reporting nothing amiss \u2013 but with a strange gleam in their eyes. They merged back into the kuah-lij culture, and immediately set about sabotaging it, destroying it from within.","Despite their placid lives, the kuah-lij had many thousands of years of history to draw upon, and were able to take this in stride. Yet even as they isolated the tainted members of their society and set about investigating the cause of this in detail, the invaders of the deeps began to strike, poisoning food supplies, then attacking Kuah-lij undersea cities, often overwhelming them without warning or survivors.","As the years passed, the kuah-lij culture became more militant, fighting a war against a race they had almost no information about. The battle has entered a kind of stalemate: the Kuah-lij have many sea-based vessels and devices to use against their foes, but the enemies of the deep, which resemble aboleths, are surmised to have secret aid from an extraplanar source, and also apparently limitless numbers.","The kuah-lij have turned some of their efforts to exploring distant worlds, in this plane and beyond, for answers to the origins of their attackers, and how to deal with them. This is their single, overriding concern.","Kuah-lij are defined by their class levels \u2013 they do not possess racial Hit Dice.

Despite knowledge of their superior genie status as compared to mortal spellcasters, they often serve as familiars to powerful mages, especially the genie-friends known as daivrat. They can be summoned with the ","Each zhyen appears as a miniature djinni from the waist up, broadly muscular and attractive. Beneath the waist, the zhyen has no form at all, instead dissipating into a \u201ctail\u201d of the genie\u2019s favored element: a wisp of mist for air, a flowing wave for water, a trail of flame for fire, or a seemingly endless shower of stone for earth. This appearance is reflected in the skin tone of the zhyen as well, but has no influence on the genie\u2019s powers or abilities.","Zhyen inhabit the elemental plane that corresponds to their elemental type. Some planar scholars believe that these miniature genies are portions of the planes that have grown sentience and broken off from the elemental fabric. Others declare them to be minor genies, a sort of offshoot of the greater races. Still others claim that a zhyen is created when a powerful genie desires a thinking, agreeable companion, not unlike the means by which human mages craft homunculi.","In truth, zhyen arise from all of these methods. Whatever the engine behind its creation, a zhyen appears fully formed and coherent, taking only minutes to acclimate to its surrounds and learn what\u2019s needed of it. If \u201cborn\u201d near another sentient being, a zhyen forms a fond attachment to that creature, until such time as the companion demonstrates its unwillingness or inability to treat the zhyen kindly.","With no need to eat (though they enjoy it) and unfazed by harsh environments, zhyen tend not to keep permanent homes, instead choosing to wander the fringes of the elemental realms. They are curious beings, however, and endlessly seek diversion. On the planes, zhyen satisfy their curiosity by exploring the boundaries where one domain or element blends into another. This curiosity often finds them as captives to more powerful beings.","Zhyen are most drawn to places where opposing forces clash and meld into one another. On the Material Plane, they are drawn to shorelines and waterfalls, to great mountain peaks, and\u2014curiously enough\u2014tea kettles and soup pots. Most zhyen cannot remain on the Material Plane except in the service of a powerful spellcaster, but will gladly trade servitude of convenience over slavery to an efreeti or shaitan master.","Zhyen have no natural predators or prey. Although they may appear to be male or female, they are actually genderless, and do not breed. Zhyen do not age.","The smaller size and lesser power of zhyen among genie-kind make it nearly impossible for them to carve out any sort of society in the planes. As a result, most zhyen find themselves as servants to genies of greater power, employed as messengers and pets in the courts of greater genie races. Zhyen dislike such treatment, but given their relative weakness compared to other genies, they are unable to alter their status.","Occasionally, a zhyen summoned to the Material Plane is astounded by the diverse wonders of the mortal world, and seeks to return. Such zhyen respond to summonings and callings as often as possible, and may eventually seek to join the world entirely as a familiar to a daivrat. Service to a daivrat allows the zhyen to sate its curiosity and need for exploration, while gaining the benefit of a master capable of protecting it from greater genies looking to exploit a lesser creature.","Once conjured to the Material Plane, zhyen often seek ways to stay beyond the duration of the magic that brought them there. They sometimes find minor magic items that allow them to persist in the mortal world, and often maintain a watch over favored mortals and their descendants, providing minor aid when it is possible to do so without being detected. ","Even on the Material Plane, zhyen do not seek the company of other zhyen of their own elemental type, and find zhyen of other elementals to be amusing oddities and curious acquaintances at best. They have an odd affinity for mephits, particularly those who represent mixed elements.","Some zhyen are unfortunate enough to be enslaved by cruel, malicious genies or exploitive mortal masters, usually for the purpose of humiliating pranks or jester-like performances. Over time this weighs on a zhyen\u2019s spirit, corrupting it from within until the zhyen\u2019s body undergoes a physical transformation that reflects this inner suffering. The zhyen grows legs where its elemental half used to be and goes completely bald, and its skin assumes a duller, more human-like color and texture. The resulting creature is a petty genie-creature called a jocta. The change frees the jocta from whatever binding spells enslaved its as a zhyen; most immediately flee before they are bound again. Most jocta are chaotic neutral or neutral evil.","A jocta retains all of its zhyen abilities and can change from Tiny to Small size or back at will as a free action (this is a supernatural ability). A jocta may be summoned like a zhyen or even bound as a familiar, but it is sullen and uncooperative, enjoying nothing more than returning to a former \u201cmaster\u201d and snatching a few items of value or sentiment from him before slipping off once again."]},"Zhen":{"title":"Zhen","spell":[],"description":["Barely thicker than hempen rope, this orange-banded worm stretches many feet in length."]},"Zombie":{"title":"Zombie","spell":[],"description":["A stumbling crush of moaning, reaching bodies comes towards you."]},"Unhallowed":{"title":"Unhallowed","spell":["light"],"description":[]},"Void":{"title":"Void","spell":["true seeing","energy drain","energy drain","fire shield","fly","true seeing","deeper darkness","gaseous form","greater dispel magic","greater teleport","invisibility","minor creation","vision","cone of cold","demand","dominate person","major creation","mass charm monster","polar ray","teleport object","implosion","plane shift","giant form II","greater teleport","plane shift","teleport object","disintegrate","forceful hand","grasping hand","greater shout","blade barrier","keen edge","mage\u2019s sword","transformation"],"description":["This towering, three-eyed horned giant carries himself with the self-assurance of an undefeated champion of countless wars."]},"Zoog":{"name":"Zoog","cr":"1","xp":"400","race":"","alignment":"CN","size":"Tiny","type":"magical beast","ac":"14","hp":"11","hd":"2d10","melee":"bite +6 (1d3-2 plus bleed 1), 2 claws +6 (1d2-2)","ranged":"","space":"5","reach":"5","stat":{"str":"6","dex":"15","con":"10","int":"5","wis":"12","cha":"5"},"feats":"Weapon Finesse","skills":["Acrobatics +12"," Climb +12"," Perception +5"],"subtype":[]},"Abyssal":{"title":"Abyssal","spell":["plane shift","dismissal","dispel chaos","dispel evil","banishment","plane shift"],"description":["This gigantic beast stands at least 40 feet tall.

Witnesses of danse macabres, however, tend to disagree, and the manifestation of a danse macabre can quickly depopulate a location through both its depredations and the flight of any survivors.

Possessing no intelligence or agenda, they lash out at whatever living things pass nearby, regardless of the target\u2019s size, sentience, or potential deadliness. A mature plant consists of a main vine, about 20 feet long; smaller vines up to 5 feet long branch off from the main vine about every 6 inches. These small vines bear clusters of leaves, and in late summer they produce bunches of small fruits that resemble wild blackberries. The fruit is tough and has a hearty and typically bitter flavor, although some say the berries change in taste depending on what victims composted a given plant\u2019s roots. The most murderous assassin vines supposedly produce the sweetest berries. ","An assassin vine can move about, but usually stays put unless it needs to seek prey in a new vicinity. The plants use simple tactics, lying still until prey comes within reach and then attacking. Once an assassin vine is engaged, it pursues prey (albeit slowly) in order to catch and compost the creature. The plants prove tenacious, as long as their quarry remains within sight. Once a creature moves beyond the plant\u2019s ability to perceive it, the unthinking vine falls still and lies in wait for the next passerby.

Known for their magic-warping shells, flail snails roam slowly through subterranean caverns writing great epics in their slime trails.","Of all the bizarre creatures that haunt the caves and crevasses of the subterranean world, the flail snail is one of the strangest. As slow for its size as its diminutive cousins, the flail snail fears little from underground predators, thanks to its nigh-impermeable armor and the powerful, mace-like pseudopods that give it its name. Yet the most curious trait of this docile denizen lies is in the singular properties of its shell, which not only defends the creature against magic, but is capable of warping spells and flinging them back at their caster.","Slow and easily avoidable due to their telltale slime trails, flail snails tend to be peaceful unless actively threatened or approached too closely. At these times, the sedately waving tentacles on the creature\u2019s head become an intricately woven blur, the horn-like growths at their tips whistling as they\u2019re flung with terrific force by long strands of muscle. Each swipe of these biological flails is capable of staving in a man\u2019s chest, and though most creatures have plenty of time to retreat, those who press their luck or run afoul of the flail snail\u2019s mucilaginous secretions come out the other side as a red smear on the cavern floor.","The average flail snail stands 8 feet high at the top of its shell and 12 feet long, though the highly elastic nature of its flesh allows it to stretch out much farther. When threatened by an opponent not easily dispatched by its whirling tentacles, the flail snail can retract its entire body into its massive spiral shell, plugging the opening with its four rock-hard flails. These shells are frequently streaked with bright colors in patterns that differ between individuals; older snails tend to have larger shells with more elaborate markings, some of which may appear to resemble runes or symbols. Adult flail snails can weigh several thousand pounds, yet thanks to their slime they still manage to cling perfectly to the stone floors, walls, and even ceilings where they graze, feeding their prodigious bulk on fields of fungus, mold, and vermin. Though they have occasionally been known to consume carrion and the corpses of creatures they kill, this is generally believed to be due to lack of discrimination rather than malice, with the snail simply eating whatever it passes over out of habit.","Physically, flail snails differ from their lesser kindred only in their size, magical shells, and powerful antennae. Movement is achieved via a single enormous foot that takes up most of the underside of the snail\u2019s body and pulls it along by expanding and contracting in muscular ripples aided by slimy secretions. Most of the snail\u2019s day is spent eating with the help of a radula, a long ribbon of tongue studded with thousands of tiny tooth-like structures that act like a rasp, scraping organic matter from the stone and shredding it into pieces for digestion. The constant need to eat leads the snails to migrate frequently, either alone or in slow-moving colonies called routs, and any cavern or dungeon with sufficient organic matter growing on the walls is prime real estate to a flail snail, regardless of what any other inhabitants might think.","Like other slugs and snails, the tentacle-like protrusions on the flail snail\u2019s head are its primary sensory organs, with the top pair sensing light and the lower providing the sense of smell and handling most tactile and fine manipulation duties. Both pairs can be retracted up to the horny growths at the end, and regrow in a month if lost. Even without these sensors, the snail can still move about reasonably well, as its suction with the ground allows it to sense its surroundings via tremors in the rock. This is especially useful since striking out with its powerful flails leads to them being easily damaged in combat.","Though the flail snail\u2019s shell gets the most attention from adventurers and scholars, its slime trail is even more important to its defense and daily life. Like many other gastropods, the flail snail\u2019s slime comes in two types: thin and slippery or thick and sticky. Both are effective at stopping those seeking to invade the snails\u2019 territory, and allow the snails enough suction to climb walls and ceilings without faltering. Mixing the two even allows the snails to create a sticky rope capable of suspending them in the air, lowering themselves or climbing back up with astonishing ease.","Flail snails are born from clutches of up to 30 eggs stuck to cavern walls or buried beneath interesting objects (such as altars or lost treasure hordes). Fully hermaphroditic, flail snails begin their courtship ritual by extruding long, chitinous spears that they stab into each other\u2019s flesh, injecting hormones signaling their intent. They then climb as a pair to the highest point available and begin copulating, lowering their entwined bodies on a massive rope of slime and hanging there for hours or days until mating is finished, at which point they may be forced to gnaw off their own reproductive organs in order to separate. Both individuals then lay egg clutches, and the hatchlings\u2014which start out already shelled, the size of a human\u2019s hand\u2014are raised by the community, with no concept of lineage or heredity. Any flail snail sensing a hatchling in danger instantly rushes to its defense, regardless of personal peril. Matings happen sporadically and may be tied to available food sources, though the fact that flail snails appear to be able to live for hundreds or thousands of years makes reproduction a relatively rare occurrence. Under duress, flail snails have even been observed to retract into their shells and go into long periods of hibernation, making it possible that some of the snails currently active are far older than anyone realizes.","Of course, no discussion of the flail snail\u2019s ecology would be complete without mention of its shell. A magnificent spiral construction several inches thick, the flail snail\u2019s shell grows slowly over time, generated by an organ on the snail\u2019s back known as its mantle, which in turn is fed by metals and minerals scraped in tiny amounts from the stone and ingested as part of the snail\u2019s diet. The wide array of substances used to produce the shell appears to be at least partially responsible for the whorls of color and strange patterns that cover it, though the fact that these often glow after being targeted by magic suggests other factors as well.","Exactly how the shell manages to reflect magic has long baffled scholars, who have put forth numerous theories. Some suggest that it\u2019s due to the ingestion and combination of various magically reactive metals used in the shell\u2019s construction. Others posit that the shell is a focus for the snail\u2019s own magical energies, and that by the whim of gods or evolution the snail has been restricted to using its powers in a retributive manner, an example of perfect natural balance. Still others maintain that the snail\u2019s shell resonates with magic like a bell, acting as a sort of magical tuning fork whose vibration scatters the waves of energy. Perhaps the most compelling argument is that it\u2019s not the shell\u2019s composition that is key, but rather its shape. This theory holds that the flail snail shell has evolved in a perfect golden spiral, a shape long significant to arcanists and engineers, and that this shape manages to draw magic down into its center and then expel it again in a new direction, like a whirlpool or tornado.","Characters with ranks in ","With their slow, ponderous movement, flail snails are often written off as dumb beasts by faster-moving races, afforded the same cautious respect as a bull in a pasture but otherwise ignored. This casual disregard is a mistake, however, for behind the flail snail\u2019s slug-like exterior lies an alien intelligence and thousands of years of racial history. Flail snail intelligence is not humanoid intelligence.","Most civilized humanoids tend to value speed and inference in their decision-making, traits born of an evolution as soft, delicate things in a world of powerful predators. As a creature of ultimate defense and slow movement, the flail snail has none of the same needs. Instead, its own unique brand of consciousness is correspondingly slow and placid, prone to the absorption of vast amounts of information rather than any need to process or leap to conclusions.","A typical human who managed to communicate with a flail snail might well find the conversation dull, with the snail viewing every thought and detail as separate and unrelated from the others. Yet those monks or other scholars used to such things might recognize in the snail\u2019s koan-like observations a certain Zen poetry hinting at deeper revelations\u2014and indeed, if enlightenment is judged by perfect calm and inherent peace of mind, then the meditative flail snail may yet have the advantage over humanity. Certainly their lives are more pastoral, free from war and the other \u201cadvances\u201d of civilization.","Though they have no spoken language, flail snails communicate using two different means, both completely silent. The first, an elaborate sign language of waving tentacles, is primarily used for communicating immediate needs, warnings, and other messages that are quickly picked up and passed through the rout. The second and more in-depth form of communication is a complex chemical writing system encoded within the snail\u2019s slime.","Every flail snail has its own unique chemical signature that makes its slime trail immediately recognizable to other snails. Within its trail, each snail records a running dialogue of its thoughts, observations, and memories in a complex interaction of scents that can linger on the stone long after the slime has dried to dust. Other snails can read this dense stream of information and edit it with their own trails, creating a vast, interwoven cultural narrative that at once contains the snails\u2019 greatest art and the sum of their collective history. Together, the slime trails of two dozen snails weave epic tales worthy of any philosopher-poet.","Flail snails do not build structures or cities\u2014perhaps because of their lack of fine manipulators, or merely because they\u2019ve transcended such impulses\u2014and instead roam the Darklands singly or in vast troupes, eating their fill, sleeping a few hours a day, and recording their endless songs in the glistening slicks of their passing.","Flail snails are perfect monsters to shake up subterranean adventures, especially for parties heavy on spellcasters. With their magic-warping shells, the snails add an element of randomness that can be fun and surprising for both GM and players, and force parties into new strategies. Because of their slow speed and ability to make vast swaths of ground almost impassable, flail snails make better guardians than active predators. Perhaps someone has hidden a powerful magic item or spellbook in the center of flail snail territory, knowing that those most likely to hunt for it\u2014spellcasters\u2014will have the hardest time breaking through the flail snails\u2019 lines. And even those parties without a strong magical component are likely to balk at adhesive mucus and 2,000-pound snails dropping toward them from a great height on ropes of slime.","Flail snails are intelligent, and hence cannot be used as animal companions, but they can make great allies for other subterranean creatures. Mites, with their love of vermin, might relish riding slowly into combat on the armored back of a flail snail, and kobolds used to riding slurks might appreciate the snails\u2019 ability to travel across floors and ceilings with equal ease, helping to set up traps and ambushes. Nor is the use of flail snails restricted to evil races\u2014having little concept of good or evil themselves, the snails are equally likely to ally with svirfneblin or other deep-dwelling races. If a PC has the patience for it, a snail might even make a fun and unusual PC mount, though it should be noted that the snail\u2019s shell does little to protect its rider, and anyone hoping to cling to the snail while upside down on the ceiling had better fashion some sort of harness, or else secure herself with snail slime.","Flail snails see little need for treasure, or even personal possessions, as their homes, weapons, and armor are all directly attached to their bodies. At most, a flail snail\u2019s territory might contain items dropped by slain trespassers, and more artistic individuals occasionally affix colored gems to their shells with their sticky slime (though the majority consider this a desecration of the shell\u2019s natural beauty). More than any physical object, flail snails value knowledge, history, and poetry, all gained and shared through their ascetic meanderings, and creatures capable of deciphering either of their means of communication might learn a great deal from the slow philosophers.","Yet when people speak of treasure and the flail snail, they inevitably speak of the shell. The armored spirals are a fundamental part of the snail\u2019s exoskeleton, removable only after death, and many adventurers seek them out to harvest their magic-warping wonders\u2014a practice which gives some snails a justifiably low opinion of humanoids. Removing a shell from a deceased snail is messy work, after which the looter must still find a way to carry several hundred pounds of shell out of the snail\u2019s subterranean home. As the center of the shell seems to be the focus of the magic, it\u2019s possible for a character with heavy tools or weapons to break the shell down to only the 50 pounds necessary for crafting armor and other magical pursuits, but doing so carries a 50% chance of destroying the shell\u2019s powers completely. A functional flail snail shell can sell to a master smith or item crafter for up to 800 gp, though the flail snail\u2019s intelligence makes hunting its kind a morally dubious act.","Despite its outward similarities to creatures like the giant slug or giant leech, the flail snail represents a divergent branch of evolution; neither of those distant relatives possesses the intelligence or magic-warping abilities that make the flail snail so unique. Already exceptionally rare, the flail snail\u2019s only known variants are almost identical versions that roam the surface world individually or in pairs, or those water-breathing aquatic versions that live deep under the sea or along rocky, turbulent coastlines."]},"Fungoid":{"name":"Fungoid","cr":"3","xp":"800","race":"","alignment":"NE","size":"Medium","type":"plant","ac":"18","hp":"37","hd":"5d8+15","melee":"2 slams +8 (1d8+4)","ranged":"","space":"5","reach":"5","stat":{"str":"19","dex":"12","con":"17","int":"4","wis":"11","cha":"6"},"feats":"Improved Initiative, Power Attack, Weapon Focus (slam)","skills":["Perception +10"," Stealth +6 (+14 in swampy or forested areas)"],"subtype":[]},"Gambado":{"name":"Gambado","cr":"3","xp":"800","race":"","alignment":"CN","size":"Medium","type":"aberration","ac":"14","hp":"26","hd":"4d8+8","melee":"bite +5 (1d8+2), 2 claws +5 (1d4+2)","ranged":"","space":"5","reach":"5","stat":{"str":"14","dex":"12","con":"14","int":"6","wis":"12","cha":"8"},"feats":"Alertness, Skill Focus (Stealth)","skills":["Acrobatics +6 (+14 jump)"," Perception +8"," Sense Motive +5"," Stealth +9"],"subtype":[]},"Ghoul-Stirge":{"title":"Ghoul-Stirge","spell":[],"description":["A ghoul-stirge resembles a large stirge with rotting flesh and broken wings.

Often said to be a fiend of unknown origins, the cruel-eyed night terror is infamous for his love of trickery and spontaneous bursts of violence. Those who have seen his visage and lived to tell their story often have scars to prove the authenticity of their account, as Spring-Heeled Jack\u2019s menacing knife is almost as famous as he is.","By all accounts, Spring-Heeled Jack is a small and roguish-looking man with horns, garbed in a tattered vest, cape, and trousers. However odd his clothing may be, it is generally agreed that the sight of his dreadful cape or even the shadow of his hideously quick movements chills the hearts of men.","Spring-Heeled Jack stands about 4 feet tall and weighs about 80 pounds.","Spring-Heeled Jack is a cruel being with a mysterious past; the stories of his origin vary wildly, though it is widely thought that he was at one point human, and through some twist of fate or evil transaction lost his humanity in exchange for fiendish powers.","The truth, however, is far different. Spring-Heeled Jack is a fey creature\u2014or perhaps a single name given to a whole race of fey creatures related to the quickling. Jack is fond of traveling to the Material Plane, where his mayhem is more appreciated and the results more permanent.","On his forays into the Material Plane, Spring-Heeled Jack quickly takes to the night and earns a reputation for his gruesome killing sprees and tendency to flee the crime scene by leaping onto buildings, thus giving him his name. His heinous crimes usually render him one of the most loathed criminals in a particular area, and communities where he is seen act swiftly and with urgency to capture him. Knowing precisely how far he can push the local populace, Spring-Heeled Jack often disappears for several weeks after a particularly violent crime before revealing himself again.","Spring-Heeled Jack subsists primarily on the flesh of raw animals, finding the meat of humans too stringy for his liking. His tastes are versatile, though, and he\u2019s just as prone to eat a deer as he is to consume a common house rat or beetle. The impish creature goes about most of his activities in a quirky, grotesque fashion, enamored with odd and often disturbing items and as quick to imitate the creatures he observes as he is to kill them.","Reports of Spring-Heeled Jack always place him in a large city or the outskirts of one during the night, though even the best trackers have trouble explaining where he goes during the day or during the weeks when there is not so much as a trace of him.","During those periods when he goes to ground, Spring-Heeled Jack often lurks in the wilds, either resting in secluded forests or observing the animals and other creatures native to such environs. His innate fascination with the Material Plane is an odd contrast to his love of causing others pain; the only thing he enjoys more than witnessing nature is destroying it. Hunters occasionally come across desecrated animal carcasses, returning to the tavern and proposing tales of some huge and horribly strong creature in the wilds. No one would ever guess that the gory mess of flesh and bone was caused by a tiny man with a jagged knife.","Spring-Heeled Jack\u2019s knife is often his only company, and years of self-inflicted solitude drive him to consider the blade his best and only friend. The wicked knife\u2014which he refers to as \u201cLove\u201d all too frequently, according to survivors of his attacks\u2014possesses no special properties, but is finely wrought and clearly of otherworldly origin. Stained with the blood of hundreds of victims, Spring-Heeled Jack\u2019s weapon leaves strange scars that are impossible to reproduce. Brash drunkards in taverns can be found lifting their shirts and displaying old wounds, claiming they come from Spring-Heeled Jack\u2019s beloved blade, while honest victims need not point out their true scars, which always speak for themselves.","Chaotic and spontaneous, Spring-Heeled Jack sometimes tires of simply killing victims, and instead decides to let his prey live to tell the tale. While he does not commit his heinous crimes for popularity, the fey revels in the reputation he has earned and the fear that registers in people\u2019s eyes as he pounces upon them, and often spies on people simply to hear the far-fetched rumors surrounding himself.","He frequently plays up these odd rumors and accounts, even whispering pre-scripted lines to his victims before he kills them, fancying himself a poet reciting to a very select audience.","Beyond brief encounters with terrified victims and his strange relationship with his weapon, Spring-Heeled Jack is alone in his endeavors. Society holds no place for him, but that\u2019s fine by the sociopathic fey. His high esteem for misfortune, trickery, and deceit are matched by few, and he cannot be bought off, persuaded, or convinced. The only thing that could possibly distract him in the middle of pursuing a victim is the possibility of some other, more exciting challenge elsewhere. When Spring-Heeled Jack encounters a foe he deems too powerful, he takes to the roofs as soon as he realizes his situation, often to the frustration of bounty hunters and law enforcement alike."]},"Bronze":{"title":"Bronze","spell":["control water","control weather","create food and water","detect thoughts","fog cloud","speak with animals","freedom","tsunami","antipathy","discern location","storm bolts","mass fly","spell turning","statue","greater dispel magic","mass suggestion","mislead","dismissal","interposing hand","mind fog","teleport","dimension door","ice storm","solid fog","stoneskin","dispel magic","heroism","slow","suggestion","blur","gust of wind","invisibility","mirror image","web","alarm","mage armor","obscuring mist","shield","true strike","detect magic","detect poison","light","mage hand","mending","message","read magic","resistance","prestidigitation","polymorph","repulsion"],"description":[]},"Stench":{"title":"Stench","spell":[],"description":["This creature resembles a large bison with a hunched back, long downward-curving horns, and grotesque facial features.

A handful of researchers enamored with studying monsters have written about the creature, though no two accounts agree on its true nature. Some think it to be from another world or dimension, while others believe it is a plant creature of magical sentience, akin to a corrupted ","The monster never consumes its kills; it simply leaves charred corpses, twisted by fear, in its wake. Victims are found curled into a fetal position and burned so thoroughly they are barely recognizable to even their closest friends and relatives. Some speculate the creature feeds on strong feelings of agony, despair, and terror.","Most who encounter the monster are solitary travelers, miners, hunters, or farmers. This suggests the creature prefers to prey upon single targets, but a few stories tell of it attacking a wagon full of farmers returning from a day at the market or a trio of teenage boys playing around in the woods at night. Either way, as of late, most citizens don\u2019t go out alone after dark for long.","Officially, the monster exists only in the minds of drunkards and those prone to fanciful daydreams. The sparse evidence of the creature has yet to compel the local militia to mobilize any significant hunting party to eradicate the creature, and authorities who are shown places scorched by the monster\u2019s fiery jets write them off as merely small-scale wildfires caused by lightning or out-of-control campfires left by local hunters or miners. When would-be monster hunters show up, the locals have no shortage of stories to tell about the monster\u2014usually heard from a distant cousin or a friend of a friend who claimed to have seen it. Several unscrupulous merchants in the area made a small industry of selling bits of slag supposedly resulting from the monster\u2019s fire, or maps to various caves and lairs the monster might inhabit. With little credible information to go on, and the creature\u2019s ability to fly making it impossible to track, most of the hunters give up the chase after having their purses lightened at nearby inns and taverns.","To date, no lair thought to belong to the creature has been found, nor have any tracks of the monster been accurately identified (just the scorch marks from its jets of flame). Sketches of the creature hang on the walls in taverns and inns, some drawn by those who encountered the creature and lived, and others sketched by those interested in the monster and the stories about it. All of these depictions are roughly the same, though some contain certain embellishments or exaggerations, such as extra appendages, varying color schemes, or inflated body size. Some inn owners sell these drawings to monster hunters for prices that fluctuate wildly, seemingly set only by how severely the inn owners think they can gouge any particular buyer. Just last fall, a group bought a skillfully drawn illustration of the monster from a tavern for 10 gold pieces, though it was little help to the group in finding the monster.","Though the monster has became a major nuisance only in the last 30 years, stories with details matching recent accounts of the monster circulated among wanderers as long as 600 years ago. These tales, told around campfires as a warning to the traveling people, hint that a creature like the monster\u2014or even the monster itself\u2014has been a threat in the region for a long time.

At rest, their flat bodies stand roughly 5 inches tall and can stretch out to a wide diameter, their surfaces blossoming into what look like thick tangles of mossy roots and gnarled vegetation as they lie still. Known to emit invisible but dangerous chemicals, these masses of slinking muck cause nearby plants to writhe and coil as if alive, while shocking animals into a temporary but deathly torpor. As such, they rarely must hunt to find food, instead sensing passing creatures and preying upon them after they succumb to the oozes\u2019 sleep aura.

As many as 10 oozes might gather during one of these grotesque moots. To reproduce, four verdurous oozes merge to become a greater verdurous ooze. Greater oozes are far more active and hungry than their lesser kin, constantly wandering, feeding, and growing. After several months, the greater verdurous ooze splits into 10 to 15 new verdurous oozes. These new verdurous oozes grow to full size within 6 months.","Verdurous oozes primarily live in temperate forests and plains among high grasses or cultivated crops, though they might also be found in warm plains and jungle environments. As mindless creatures, they pay little attention to others of their kind, save when drawn to reproduce.

Over time, this can lead to an increase in the fauna in the area, as they seek to enjoy the rich, lush plants that make up their diet and in turn become prey for the stealthy ooze.

Those who have \u201cconversed\u201d with a wyrd in this way describe an alien mode of communication that is as much raw emotion and image as it is concept and word, and a mysterious mixture of knowledge and ignorance. For instance, when first encountered, a wyrd apparently does not understand how different from itself mortals are, or how dangerous storms are to mortal creatures. Overlying everything is an unsettlingly alien but somehow childlike inquisitiveness, mixed with rage or fear if the wyrd feels threatened.","The form this interest takes can vary widely.

Several accounts agree that once wyrds understand the peril in which storms place mortals, they use their command of the weather to end the storm, even though this apparently forces them to either leave or vanish altogether. To some, this suggests that comozant wyrds possess at least some respect for life, and that what seems like cruelty may simply be uncomprehending curiosity, even playfulness.","Naturally, those who have suffered at a wyrd\u2019s whim are unsympathetic to this view.","One of the few things almost all accounts agree on is that the touch of a comozant wyrd\u2019s illuminating flames seems to confer sudden insight.

One way or another, very few of the available reports fail to mention the author glimpsing a secret she could not otherwise learn, an answer\u2014or at least a hint\u2014to a puzzle she had been attempting to solve, or a flash of inspiration that enabled her to complete some great work.

The surviving eggs hatch, releasing larvae that molt and shed their skins while feeding on organic matter and microorganisms in the water. Then they enter a pupal stage, conserving energy as they undergo a final transformation before finally emerging as fully grown adults.

"]},"Skrik":{"title":"Skrik","spell":["levitate","dispel magic"],"description":["Shoals of skrik nettles float through the skies of the First World. They sail like boats, driven before the wind and using their feathers to tack and turn. They sing as they fly, jabbering and chirping to each other in complex harmonies. The average skrik nettle shoal consists of three dozen or more of the majestic creatures, but these flocks are often split up during the roaring storms so common to the First World. Lone skrik nettles may be encountered in smaller numbers, confused and trying to find their way back to their kin.","Skrik nettles range in size from a few inches across (for a newly spawned hatchling) to the size of gigantic, scintillating clouds. Most, however, are no more than 8 or 9 feet across.","Skrik nettles are primarily scavengers, although they will attack suitable prey when hungry. Their method of attack is curious. The sharp beaks of a skrik nettle drip with a magical poison that is injected when the creature bites a foe. The victim of the poison feels slightly nauseous and light-headed at first\u2014and then begins to float off the ground.","As long as the poison pumps through the veins of the skrik nettle\u2019s victim, the victim keeps floating up into the sky. The victim has no control over this magical levitation\u2014unless she has some other method of controlling her flight, such as wings or magic, or she can grab a convenient tree branch, she will keep ascending until the poison wears off and gravity takes hold once more. The skrik nettles usually float up alongside their prey, keeping it floating by injecting more poison as soon as it starts to drop. Especially dangerous or hardshelled prey might be poisoned, allowed to rise, and then dropped repeatedly from a height until dead.","The poison\u2019s effects seem to be rooted in magic, rather than venom, and dispelling the ailment has proven to be just as effective as bleeding a victim. Before aiding a victim, however, one must take caution to tie said creature down securely, as there are few deaths more ironic than being cured of a skrik nettle\u2019s poison only to instantly plunge to earth from a great height. Oddly, in addition to traditional remedies, killing a skrik nettle also instantly cancels the effects of its poison.","Once every year, skrik nettles return to their shoal\u2019s spawning grounds to reproduce. The jellyfish-like creatures form hard, rugged eggs inside their bodies, then float gently down to the spawning ground\u2014usually a jungle clearing or warm swamp\u2014and dig nests with their tentacles. Skrik nettles are hermaphrodites, so each one lays its eggs and then fertilizes those of its neighbor (this cross-breeding strengthens future generations of skrik nettles). The average skrik nettle lays three or four eggs, whose size ranges from that of a clenched fist to that of a giant\u2019s skull.","These eggs incubate in the warm earth for several days, during which time the skrik nettles patrol above the spawning ground, attacking anyone who might disturb the eggs. When ready to hatch, the eggs explode out of the ground and shoot into the sky, bursting into a swarm of newborn skrik nettles. Unwary travelers who slip past the patrolling skrik nettles can trigger a premature hatching if they walk over the spawning ground; such travelers may be pummeled by flying, rock-hard egg shards, or even carried into the sky by a particularly large hatchling.","Hatchling skrik nettles are ravenously hungry when born. To provide for the needs of their young, skrik nettle shoals assemble caches of poisoned meat and float them over the spawning ground. A wary explorer can spot a spawning ground from afar if she notices rotting corpses hanging overhead. Skrik nettle eggs can often be sold to the fey. Some train young skrik nettles as songbirds, teaching all six beaks to sing in harmony. Others wrap skrik nettle eggs in cloth filled with golden dust or brightly colored pollen; when an egg prepared in such a manner flies into the sky and explodes upon hatching, the cloth\u2019s contents scatter across the sky like a beautiful firework. Such entertainments are popular at parties\u2014though the ensuing swarm of carnivorous jellyfish swooping down on the guests is considered less enchanting.","Skrik nettles dwell amid the clouds, descending only to feed and procreate. They use their songs to keep the shoal together, flying toward the chirping music of their kin. Bards are often able to lure skrik nettles down to them with their enchanting melodies, but once within range, the poisonous creatures usually trade this performance for a live meal.","Skrik nettles are not especially intelligent predators\u2014 thus, they eat the bounty of the land, or, if particularly lucky, snatch a dead or weak creature from the ground. While skittish, they retaliate when attacked, regarding the assault as a chance to feed. Settlements in regions where skrik nettle migrations are common usually keep a few sacrificial animals handy to lure the skrik nettles away during a hunt. The one exception is where the skrik nettle\u2019s spawning grounds are involved\u2014during the time before a hatching, the skrik nettle shoal patrols the area around the spawning grounds and viciously attacks any trespassers. Skrik nettles are also a hazard to flyers. They lurk in low-hanging clouds, letting their tendrils trail down out of the mist. An unwary bird or flying creature can be stung, grabbed, and whisked off to be eaten in a matter of seconds. When scavenging, they fly at a low level above the landscape, letting their tendrils play over the ground as they search for carrion.","Skrik nettles themselves have few natural predators. They are reputed to taste so light and airy that eating one is like trying to eat a soap bubble, albeit a soap bubble with a half-dozen stinging beaks. Skrik nettles perceive the world by sensing air currents and shifting vibrations through their sensitive tentacles; during storms or strong winds, they secure themselves in the forks of large trees and wait out the harsh weather.","Some fey hunt the skrik nettle shoals in little flying boats for sport, bringing them down with weighted nets or leaden harpoons. A few fey even try riding skrik nettles, \u201cdocking\u201d them to make them harmless by clamping their beaks shut and then hanging a saddle from the tentacles, but the creatures are too weak to make good steeds. It is also the fashion in some regions for noble faerie-maidens to be accompanied by a small flock of \u201cdocked\u201d skrik nettles, each one bearing a fan, mirror, or basket of fruit in its tentacles. Others capture skrik nettles and train them to speak\u2014the skrik nettles are not intelligent, but they can be taught to imitate the speech of the First World, much like parrots can learn to imitate human tongues. A trained skrik nettle can even hold conversations with itself, with each of its half-dozen tentacles imitating a different voice."]},"Stroke":{"title":"Stroke","spell":["confusion","dancing lights","detect evil","detect good","detect thoughts","dispel magic"],"description":["A handsome and wicked looking young man of sleight build with sharply pointed ears, small goat like horns jutting from their broad temples.

"]},"Stymphalides":{"title":"Stymphalides","spell":[],"description":["Man-eating birds of prey, the rare creatures known as stymphalides stalk the arid plains and coastlines of Golarion in ravenous swarms, shredding warm-blooded animals and unwary travelers with their bladed feathers and dagger-like beaks. From a distance, stymphalides might easily be mistaken for cranes, ibises, or other long- necked birds, though in full sunlight their gleaming feathers and the haze of blood lingering from past meals are impossible to mistake.","Peculiarly, the feathers and beak of a stymphalides are made of steel, similar to the metallic hide of a gorgon.","The wings of stymphalides are as sharp as knives and often lacerate their prey as the birds swarm and beat their wings against their unfortunate victims\u2019 skin. Similarly, their beaks are supernaturally sharp and can pierce the tough hides of animal prey or the armor of those warriors foolish enough to hunt the creatures. Even if a victim of a stymphalides swarm\u2019s frenzied attacks manages to fend off the vicious creatures, the wounds caused by the birds continue to bleed long after being inflicted, and the victim often perishes from loss of blood before ever reaching help.","Most stymphalides stand approximately 2-1\/2 feet tall and weigh little more than 40 pounds. Although mean-tempered and territorial, lone stymphalides prove relatively harmless, thus traveling in swarms of several dozen, relying on strength of numbers to bring down large or dangerous prey. Many tales also tell of enormous breeds of these monstrous birds, powerful enough to prey upon wyverns. These giant stymphalides are said to grow up to 13 feet tall and weigh over 250 pounds, with wingspans reaching upward of 25 feet. Such gigantic stymphalides are rarely seen, preferring to lurk upon desolate cliffs or even amid harsh extraplanar realms.","Unlike vultures and other birds of the deserts and plains, stymphalides do not scavenge carcasses, although they are not above driving away natural scavengers if a large, fresh kill looks particularly inviting. When traveling in flocks, stymphalides prove fearless predators, swooping in and swarming any creature that wanders into their territory. The birds actively hunt their prey, harrying and killing lone individuals or stragglers. The attacks of a stymphalides swarm often prove so vicious that the creatures can take to flight once they have wounded prey, wait for it to bleed to death, and return to pick the corpse clean.","Stymphalides generally avoid attacking large groups of people, unless the birds have gathered in a particularly sizable flock.","Stymphalides are not purely carnivorous. A lone stymphalides might resort to eating fruit and other plants if it is separated from its flock or food is scarce, and orchards and fields of crops have been devastated by stymphalides when great swarms of the birds, starving from overpopulation or lack of prey, migrate to new territories. Yet although the birds are omnivorous, they seem to prefer meat. Those plainsfolk or desert-dwellers whose livelihoods depend on livestock have learned to fear the sight of flocks of birds silhouetted against the sky, as herds of cattle and other grazing animals have been ravaged by their swarms.","Most swarms of stymphalides roost near watering holes, rivers, and coastal cliffs, preying upon unfortunate creatures desperate enough to seek food or water so near to the dangerous birds\u2019 nests. The nests of stymphalides are frequently made from the bones of the creatures\u2019 prey, piled into macabre ziggurats upon which entire flocks of the birds rest. Particularly large flocks of the birds construct enormous nests, and giant stymphalides can create towers visible for miles.","When not at rest, flocks of the creatures soar high on warm currents of air, relying upon their keen eyesight to spot suitable prey far below. Because of their voracious appetites, flocks of stymphalides must claim a vast swath of territory to maintain their feeding habits. Stymphalides are fiercely territorial, and flocks of the birds frequently fight with one another in swooping aerial battles to determine possession of land.","Fortunately for the folk of civilized lands, stymphalides rarely encroach upon areas well traveled by humanoids and other creatures clever enough to bring down one of these metal-winged avians. Among the people of the plains, the metallic birds are often regarded as nearly legendary creatures. Stymphalides breed at an astonishing rate, however, and overpopulation and exhaustion of game frequently force extraordinarily large and deadly groups of the creatures to band together in search of new lands and new prey to devour."]},"Swan":{"title":"Swan","spell":["dancing lights","confusion","deep slumber","entangle","glitterdust","major image","beast shape I"],"description":["Swan maidens are "]},"Tear":{"title":"Tear","spell":["detect thoughts","produce flame","searing light","magic jar","Remove curse"],"description":["First spawned by a primordial godling, these fiery, parasitic "]},"Temporal":{"title":"Temporal","spell":["slow","slow","slow","haste","haste","time stop","temporal stasis"],"description":["A six-foot long hairy, gray spider crawls forth.

Brought into being to serve as lifeless engines of war or to wreak havoc upon their creators\u2019 enemies, bonestorms purposefully brought into existence have slightly more direction than their spontaneously forming counterparts. Upon completing a task, however, its not uncommon for one of these cyclones of bones to indulge its motivating rage, attacking and destroying living things far in excess of its creator\u2019s wishes.","A bonestorm typically rises to about 10 feet tall, though it has no weight besides the hundreds of pounds of bones caught up in its macabre vortex.","Bonestorms are wholly unnatural creations, formed of tortured souls and rage.

If successfully rebuked, one of these undead swarms can be directed to follow simple commands, though once its instructions are exhausted, it goes back about its assault on the living.","Bonestorms are most commonly found wherever residual ill will and a sufficient supply of raw bone material permits them to subsist: graveyards, battlefields, and catacombs being most common. While bonestorms often rise from the corpses of defeated armies\u2014especially those defeated while defending their countries, on religious crusades, or fighting for other strongly held beliefs\u2014such grim sites are by no means the only places these horrors form. In some cases, bonestorms have been known to rise from trash mounds piled high with the discarded bones of wasted or maltreated animals, from the catacombs of the dishonored dead, from shipwreck sites on lonely desolate coastlines, and even from the ashes of unjustly burned outcasts. Wherever the lingering wrath of numerous souls and a large number of bones come together in one place, there might a bonestorm form.","Although mindless, bonestorms do seem to be drawn to burial grounds, ossuaries, and similar areas of death.

The canopy creeper resembles a mass of thickly knotted and twisted jungle vines that correspond to the colors and varieties of its native habitat. It has a larger knot of this tangle at its center mass, which also conceals a large, beak-like maw. The canopy creeper can spread itself over a broad area to resemble little more than this network of vines, or it can draw itself up into a large, coiled mass with its beak exposed.","The actual vines that coil together to form the canopy creeper are hundreds of feet long altogether in an adult specimen. When spread out, these tangles of vine cover an area 20 feet in diameter. They congregate into a mass approximately 10 feet in diameter when drawn in together. The mass of a canopy creeper weighs about 3,000 pounds in total. A canopy creeper can live for hundreds of years in a hospitable climate if sufficient sunlight and food sources are available.","Canopy creepers are plants naturally evolved to take advantage of their surroundings. They grow amid the lush foliage of jungles or rain forests where a diverse array of vine plants proliferates. The canopy creeper climbs up among the tree tops and intertwines its own vine-grown body with those that grow naturally, enabling it to gain control over the naturally occurring network of vines to use as a source of both defense and sustenance. While a canopy creeper does gain food and energy from photosynthesis, it cannot maintain its active metabolism when relying only on the nutrients gleaned from sun and rain. For maximum efficiency, it uses the vine tendrils that it gains control of to detect by scent, to entrap, and to draw prey toward itself. It is also able to use these vine tendrils to procure food as they draw the nutrient-rich fluids from creatures entangled within their embrace, which are then conveyed back to the controlling canopy creeper.","While the canopy creeper\u2019s primary method of attack is through its vine tendrils, it does have a large beak mouth composed of a hard, hornlike material. This beak is normally concealed within the center of its vine mass, but when creatures approach that prove able to resist its vine tendril attacks, the canopy creeper tries to draw them in close enough so that it can attack with its beak as well. It can consume prey with this mouth, but this is not its preferred method of feeding as most of the prey\u2019s fluids are lost as the beak tears the creature apart, resulting in fewer nutrients than if it were to feed solely through the vine tendrils.","A canopy creeper naturally mimics the appearance and growth of the types of vines that grow in its environment, so when one is concealed among the vine-tangled foliage above, it is difficult for even an experienced outdoorsman to detect. This is further exacerbated by the fact that it is usually hanging about 100 feet above the ground, making its appearance even more difficult to discern. Canopy creepers\u2019 preferred prey is Medium or larger creatures since these tend to hold more of the nutrient-rich fluids that the creepers feed upon; meanwhile, Small and smaller creatures\u2014such as small ","Canopy creepers store a great deal of moisture from their normally wet habitat in their vine structures, making them difficult to burn. However, this fact, as well as their adaptation to warm climates, makes them particularly susceptible to cold attacks, which cause them to become brittle and prone to fractures in their vine structures.","A canopy creeper out of its habitat is a canopy creeper in serious trouble. The creature relies on the prolific presence of other vine growths to camouflage its presence and to provide an aerial habitat from which it can feed safely above most creatures that might prey upon it. As a result, if a canopy creeper is caught on the ground away from screening foliage, it flies into a berserk frenzy, lashing out with its beak as it attempts to make for the nearest tree or high ground to escape.","A well-fed canopy creeper buds once every 4 or 5 years and drops dozens of small seedlings to the ground.

Both have brawny muscles that bulge from the gender-neutral robes and hides they garb themselves in, and both are equally hateful by nature. Even during pregnancy, female cyclopes remain as toned and brutal as their male companions, some even going so far as to brawl until the moment of birth is upon them.

In ages past, this gift of prognostication was much more powerful and aided the soothsayers in the founding of mighty cyclops empires. Now, a cyclops\u2019s all-seeing eye is as much a curse as it is a gift; with it, a cyclops sees visions of glories yet to come but also the suffering and death that have followed its kind throughout the millennia. To view the world through this great eye is enough to drive the unwary mad, and even those who can make use of such an eye as a dangerous relic think twice before consulting its otherworldly divinations.","In addition to common cyclopes, there exists a stronger, even more bestial breed known as great cyclopes. These shaggy brutes lack the rudimentary intelligence and gift of foresight their kin possess, but make up for these shortcomings with their terrifying strength and unpredictable bouts of horrendous rage. Their primitive nature and barbaric ferocity hark back to a simpler time among cyclops-kind, and scholars debate on the exact origins of these degenerate goliaths. Regardless of the exact reasons for the split between cyclopes and great cyclopes, the former know to fear and respect their larger kin, giving such behemoths a wide berth when encountering them in the wild. For their part, great cyclopes\u2014selfish and crude\u2014rarely associate with their weaker brethren or even their own kind, though they are easily swayed by gifts of food and treasure. Primitive or barbaric ","For some worshipers, such adoration is all mysticism and superstition, with primitive shamans seeking insights and power from blood, viewing great cyclopes as prophesied destroyers sent from the heavens. For others, such veneration truly does offer revelations into the lost ways and powers of the cyclopes, revealing\u2014and in some rare cases granting a measure of mastery over\u2014those forgotten secrets. Still others merely disguise their own cruelties and ambitions in the cloak of faith, drawing influence and might from false ceremonies and the favor of brutal giants they seek to twist to their will. Whatever their form, cyclops cults all dwell on the mysteries of insight, the future, the heavens, and the symbolic eye.","Although their empires have long fallen to the more fecund races that populate much of the world, cyclopes still remain prominent in some pockets of wilderness. The majority lair in the remote, primeval reaches of the world in small conclaves of six or fewer\u2014though such groups often grow into fully fledged tribes given enough time. Possessing but a shadow of their former ambitions, many cyclopes dwell in primitive caves with rudimentary furnishings and tools, giving nary a thought to the near-mythic triumphs of lost ages, instead content with protecting their lairs and seeking out their next meals. Still, their ever-present gift of clouded prophecy serves as a constant, hazy reminder of what was once theirs and what could be again, though only the wisest among their kind know how to interpret such clouded visions.","While small groups of cyclopes usually share the responsibility of protecting the group and seeing to its needs, tribes and larger confederations of cyclopes tend to construct simple hierarchies. The most common form of ruler among small cyclops societies is the tribal chief, a leader known in some cyclops circles as the tyrant. Individual cyclopes rise to tyranny within their tribes by exhibiting the most strength over weaker creatures, typically in the heat of battle. Cyclopes enjoy taking slaves, and place great value on the individual thralls they accumulate throughout their violent lives. Stealing or eating another cyclops\u2019s slave is the best way to shame a member of a cyclops tribe, though such depredations are also quick to spur intertribal conflicts.","Cyclopes possess only the crudest forms of agriculture when they attempt it at all, usually restricting such menial labor to the herding of easily domesticated ","Even the most learned of cyclopes know relatively little about their ancestors and the ancient empires that once belonged to their people. Most cyclopes of today are content to protect their lairs and seek out food; they give little thought to ideas such as religion or matters of the spirit, trusting more in their own strength than that of any invisible deity. Regardless of their dim-wittedness compared to their ancient ancestors, the ","Cyclopes work best as enigmatic figures of myth and legend, placed in the path of adventurers to distill eldritch knowledge or to lure the PCs toward places of antiquity with the promise of forbidden treasure. They often inhabit ancient ruins and the remains of long-forgotten kingdoms, and so dungeon-delving PCs will likely come into contact with these one-eyed behemoths eventually. To cyclopes, such crumbling markers of history are hallowed sites that serve as windows to the past. Many an adventuring company has scoured the ruins of an ancient civilization in search of lost treasure, but few have paused to ponder the peoples who constructed these crumbling edifices and their unknown purposes. A cyclops encounter serves as a great plot device to introduce PCs to the storied legacy of the ancient world without it feeling like a history lesson. A notable cyclops NPC might appear again and again throughout a campaign, either as a recurring villain or as an agent seeking aid from the PCs, perhaps in the form of retrieving some relics or artifacts pertaining to a cyclops empire\u2019s mysterious past.","Though their intentions may appear benign, at heart most cyclopes are callous creatures who view ","Cyclopes treasure their weapons above all other items, viewing their over-sized greataxes, mauls, and clubs as extensions of their own rage and strength.

A ravener is often on the move, changing lairs frequently as its territories become devoid of life.","The ravener presented here is built from a red dragon wyrm. "]},"Enormous":{"title":"Enormous","spell":[],"description":[]},"Woolly":{"title":"Woolly","spell":[],"description":["The woolly rhino is an herbivore of the Pleistocene era feeding mainly on various plants, nuts, berries, and bark, as well as large quantities of water. Thus, it is usually found in areas plentiful with water, such as riverbanks, lakes, and even marshes and swamps. The woolly rhino usually forages in the morning so encounters are more common at this time. It is mostly a solitary creature though chance encounters at a common foraging area may lead to encounters with more than one creature. Herds tend to gather near watering grounds with the females surrounding the young.","Woolly rhinos mate during the late summer or early fall. Gestation lasts about 450 days after which time the female gives birth to a single calf. Calves are dependent on their mother for about the first two years of their life. Around three years of age, the calf becomes completely independent and reaches maturity by age five.","The woolly rhino averages about 11 feet long and has two ivory horns, the longest averaging about three feet in length. Its body is covered in a thick layer of black, brown, ruddy, or yellowish-brown fur that enable it to withstand its harsh climate. The creature has poor eyesight, and relies on its senses of hearing and smell to locate sources of food and warn of impending danger.","The woolly rhino is generally passive, but reacts violently if it or its herd is threatened. It attacks by goring and trampling its foes, often opening combat by charging its foe."]},"Minor":{"title":"Minor","spell":["destruction"],"description":["Known by many names throughout nearly all cultures, grim reapers are the personifications of death and all the pain and fear associated with that state. They are universally feared by the living as harbingers of destruction and masters of all that has already passed from life. These hooded beings travel through the planes with the sole intent of bringing about the end of life, slaying with a deliberateness inscrutable to all but themselves.","While grim reapers are the most feared of their kind, they are not alone. The towering, ghostlike grim reapers are served by minor reapers, corporeal servitors that enact their master\u2019s dreadful will and meet out death\u2019s unrelenting touch. A grim reaper is 15 feet tall and, as an incorporeal creature, has no physical weight except for its equipment. Minor reapers stand 7 feet tall and weigh approximately 70 pounds.","Grim reapers have no creator and are not born by any definition of the word\u2014they simply exist, much as the multiverse itself does. Some philosophers argue that grim reapers were created along with the Negative Energy Plane, manifesting from this plane when mortalkind first realized death\u2019s terminal permanency. Others claim that multiple minor reapers meeting on the Negative Energy Plane or another area infused with overwhelming negative energy might join together to form a new grim reaper.","While similar in shape to psychopomps, reapers care little for mortal souls, reveling in the moment of death and dissolution of the impermanent, regardless of the elaborate bureaucracy that oversees the doomed.","While grim reapers stalk the planes, spreading death and despair for their own sakes, they are not alone in their endeavors. Among their many powers, grim reapers can summon lesser versions of themselves to seek out and kill specific individuals.","These minor reapers are encountered far more often than their masters, either in the service of their masters or summoned by evil magic-users to do their foul bidding. While stripped of their more powerful brethren\u2019s necromantic powers, these minor reapers are nonetheless brutal hunters and stop at nothing to achieve their objective. Minor reapers usually wait until their target is alone before appearing for battle, though if a pack of these undead assassins are sent after a group of victims, they will engage multiple targets if necessary.","If summoned by a grim reaper, minor reapers act as its additional eyes and ears, and if they are destroyed, their master is immediately aware of their obliteration. Other times, a grim reaper may summon minor reapers to aid in its escape from a battle it expects to lose, and f lees to another plane of existence where it may recover and better prepare for the annihilation of its targets.","Grim reapers possess the ability to speak to any intelligent being, and the few who have survived encounters with a reaper or its minions claim that the bringer of death spoke to them in a deep, unearthly voice like nothing in the material realm.","Minor reapers can be created by casters of 20th level or higher using the spell create greater undead."]},"Sacristan":{"name":"Sacristan","cr":"10","xp":"9,600","race":"","alignment":"LE","size":"Medium","type":"outsider","ac":"22","hp":"126","hd":"12d10+60","melee":"mwk spiked chain +18\/+13\/+8 (2d4+7) or 2 claws +17 (1d4+5)","ranged":"","space":"5","reach":"5 (10 with spiked chain)","stat":{"str":"20","dex":"16","con":"21","int":"13","wis":"14","cha":"15"},"feats":"Bleeding Critical, Cleave, Critical Focus, Great Cleave, Improved Bull Rush, Power Attack","skills":["Acrobatics +15"," Bluff +17"," Climb +17"," Intimidate +17"," Perception +17"," Sense Motive +17"," Stealth +18"],"subtype":[]},"Saumen":{"title":"Saumen","spell":["wall of ice","summon nature\u2019s ally VI","erase","whirlwind"],"description":["This leathery-faced creature stands tall and upright, with long, simian limbs and a shaggy coat. Intelligent and powerful, saumen kars are not naturally aggressive, but the hostility of their environment forces them to defend the land that supports them with ferocity, even to the death. Their natural coloration and snow-packed fur make saumen kars almost invisible among the drifts of their icy homes, leading many arctic races to refer to them as \u201cmen of snow.\u201d A long-forgotten deal made by their race in its infancy still brutally scars the body of each saumen kar, marking them with their distinctive frostbite brands\u2014though if this debt is already paid, lapsed, or growing ever greater, none can remember. An adult saumen kar stands 12 feet tall and weighs almost 2,000 pounds, but the ice and snow matted to its fur for both insulation and armor add another 1,000 pounds to its bulk.","These solitary creatures are nomadic, roaming the wastes to settle temporarily where they are lucky enough to find food, shelter, or both. They are omnivorous, but the climate dictates that the lion\u2019s share of their diet is meat, and saumen kars consume the flesh of any creature but their own kind.","Generation to generation, saumen kars pass down the ice crafting techniques that supply them with weapons, tools, and art. Occasionally a saumen kar\u2019s lair contains crude ice replicas of common implements, from storage jars to skinning tools, or even heavy-lidded ice chests. Finding their frozen works among the possessions of another race is rare, however, since saumen kar ice artifacts rarely last long outside of arctic environments.","The crude frostbite brands that mark every adult saumen kar\u2019s flesh are the gruesome expression of an ancient pact with an otherworldly being, still honored by saumen kars for both spiritual and practical reasons. The specifics of the pact are long forgotten, but some elders believe the men of snow protect something in the wastes that they have themselves forgotten. While the meaning of the brands may have become lost to their wearers, scholars of language recognize the runes as a form of ancient Giant. Even still, only one well versed in linguistics can identify the sole rune still rendered well enough to read: \u201cfavored.\u201d The runes\u2019 powers lead many to believe the saumen kars owe their protection to one of the numerous powers of the north or entities mysterious to natives of more temperate lands, though the implication of the runes being an ancient form of the Giant language also creates an unsettling link between these arctic warriors and the Deathless Frost. Whichever way other races choose to speculate, the saumen kars believe the brands\u2019 protections come from their reverence for the deadly forces of the world\u2019s summit, and they display their scars proudly, wearing no clothing or armor but the snow matted into their dense fur.","The saumen kars have learned that survival is best achieved alone or in very small groups. It is rare to meet more than one of their kind at a time, although folklore does tell of handfuls of saumen kars banding together against a particularly serious or wide-ranging threat. Wandering the wastes alone, they throw up temporary lairs wherever food or ice cliffs can be found, moving off when they have taken what they can from the land. A typical lair is little more than a rough-walled igloo or ice cave built by hefting large amounts of snow and packing it tight around the hemispheres of ice they create, before the magical effect expires.","Saumen kars\u2019 antisocial behavior is what keeps them rare, and indeed mating is almost incidental, occurring when a male\u2019s and favorably disposed female\u2019s paths happen to cross. New families rarely stay together for long, and for a creature with a lifespan of up to 300 years, their offspring grow at an alarming rate, and learn to fend for themselves early in life.","Saumen kars worship the land and the powers of the north rather than any specific deity, leading to a druidic dominance of their spiritual lives. In their final days, some saumen kars travel to sites of great natural beauty or power to die in a place where the blackened bones of many generations are tumbled together beneath ever-shifting ice and snow. From what little outsiders can gather, they are a loosely shamanic people, and some carry crude family reliquaries of teeth, bones, and fur for ancestral protection and guidance.","Saumen kars speak a dialect of Giant influenced by Druidic, though they rarely communicate with other races. Some saumen kars, through necessity, have picked up smatterings of other languages and even a word or two of Common, but their knowledge of such languages never extends beyond a handful of crude threats and warnings.","Survival in the wastes is about understanding its dangers, environmental or otherwise, and despite their primitive, animalistic appearance, saumen kars are canny combatants. Over thousands of years their proud race has learned patience and silence from the glaciers. Rather than risk a frontal assault, they utilize their natural coloration to hide in snow banks and their ability to summon powerful ursine aid to scare off enemies or track those who trespass upon their lands. Only if interlopers prove a match for their summoned allies will they cautiously join the fray, trapping physically stronger creatures in icy hemispheres or separating groups with freezing planes. They then wade in, the field rearranged to their advantage, to use their imposing size, savage axe blows, and incapacitating headbutts to cut down weaker opponents, or take snowstorm form to shred dangerous spellcasters with blinding, razor-sharp sleet."]},"Forgefiend":{"name":"Forgefiend","cr":"10","xp":"9,600","race":"","alignment":"LE","size":"Large","type":"outsider","ac":"25","hp":"137","hd":"11d10+77","melee":"bite +17 (2d6+7 plus rend armor), bite +17 (1d6+7), 2 claws +17 (1d6+7)","ranged":"","space":"10","reach":"10","stat":{"str":"24","dex":"14","con":"25","int":"15","wis":"12","cha":"15"},"feats":"Combat Reflexes, Greater SunderB, Improved Initiative, Improved Iron Will, Improved SunderB, Iron Will, Quicken Spell-Like Ability (produce flame), Vital Strike","skills":["Acrobatics +16 (+12 when jumping)"," Climb +21"," Craft (traps) +16"," Disable Device +16"," Knowledge (dungeoneering) +16"," Perception +15"," Sense Motive +15"," Stealth +12"],"subtype":[]},"Scylla":{"name":"Scylla","cr":"16","xp":"76,800","race":"","alignment":"CE","size":"Huge","type":"aberration","ac":"30","hp":"250","hd":"20d8+160","melee":"4 bites +25 (1d8+8\/19-20 plus bleed), 4 tentacles +23 (1d6+4 plus grab)","ranged":"","space":"15","reach":"15","stat":{"str":"27","dex":"32","con":"27","int":"20","wis":"23","cha":"22"},"feats":"Combat Reflexes, Dodge, Improved Critical (bite), Mobility, Multiattack, Power Attack, Vital Strike, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus (bite), Weapon Focus (tentacles)","skills":["Acrobatics +34"," Bluff +26"," Intimidate +29"," Knowledge (nature) +25"," Perception +29"," Sense Motive +26"," Stealth +26"," Swim +39"," Use Magic Device +26"],"subtype":[]},"Sepia":{"title":"Sepia","spell":["sepia snake sigil","sepia snake sigil"],"description":["Winglessly flying forth, a monstrously sized anaconda-like serpent descends from the sky.

Even larger predator fish such as marlins, tuna, and sharks can find themselves in the tightly clasped jaws of a gigas clam.","Gigas clams are primarily sedentary monsters, content to lie in wait as prey inevitably wanders toward their seemingly harmless forms. Vast fields of the titanic bivalves can be found scattered along the ocean floor of the Inner Sea, feeding on fish and any debris that falls to the bottom, including shipwreck victims and castaways thrown overboard by pirates. If no food presents itself for some time, a bed of gigas clams either relocates or crawls toward land in search of a more dependable source of food.","Gigas clams depart from their mostly passive hunting style once per year, when the bulging summer moon is at its fullest. Entire beds of the creatures propel themselves upward and burst through the surface of the water, attacking passing ships as well as coastal communities.","During these times, gigas clams seek out their most favored prey: air-breathing humanoids. Using their powerful siphons to slam into passing merchant vessels and war galleons, the massive clams are indiscriminate in their search for humanoid flesh. Though they are normally hasty and seldom use tactics to obtain their prey, occasionally a lone gigas clam uses its feminine figure to trick unsuspecting ships into gigas clam-infested waters.","The clam and its kin ruthlessly ram the vessel until its contents spill into the open water.","Once trapped inside a gigas clam\u2019s quivering and contracting musculature, victims are almost certainly doomed, as the clam\u2019s acidic innards swiftly melt and destroy anything within. When engaged in melee, a gigas clam can strike with both its fleshy siphons as well as its terrible foot, which terminates in a toothy maw that can deliver devastating wounds.","Since gigas clams openly attack land-dwellers only during 1 month out of the year, coastal communities and fisherfolk dwelling near gigas clam beds know to prepare their ships and docks for the deadly onslaughts of these creatures. But even the most formidable defenses are not enough to hold back great numbers of the clams, and most find it easier to simply avoid settling near gigas clam fields. Particularly bold monster hunters and sages travel throughout the Inner Sea during the summer in hopes of spotting the slimy beasts, using elaborate charts and maps listing past reports of the creatures to pick which areas to observe. A few whisper tales of immense magical pearls buried within the clams, which they postulate are responsible for the clams\u2019 increased size and intelligence.

Stoic, infinitely patient, and entirely dedicated to the God of Law, the Herald is like an intelligent golden volcano: mountainous and indomitable, yet capable of exacting incredible destruction. This sentinel of civilization appears where the forces of chaos threaten to undo the works of lawful communities and hinder progress\u2019s inexorable march.","Terse in nature, Lawgiver restricts communication to an unusual limit. Although the giant can speak several languages, it has only ever been heard speaking in numbers and measurements or\u2014more frequently\u2014in direct quotes from holy writings","A unique titan of living metal, the Herald has no apparent need for food, drink, rest, or other mortal comforts. On most of its rare appearances, the creature\u2019s stoicism and stillness lead even devout worshipers to mistake the giant for a reward from their god or simply one temple\u2019s ostentatious display of piety. More than once, needy clerics or thieving heretics have attempted to chip away parts of the golden herald or melt it down entirely, with the Herald\u2019s reaction varying depending on the individual assaulting. While thieves are typically crushed beneath the giant\u2019s heel, in some cases the Herald seems to have no purpose other than to allow a struggling or robbed temple to sheer off a few hundred coins\u2019 worth of gold so it might continue its work. The titan always seems to heal lost pieces when seen next, but it never grants those who summon it permission to take gold from its body.","The Herald goes where powerful worshipers of God of Law call him and where the god of cities and law orders. While a literal giant on the battlefield, often the mere suggestion of the Herald\u2019s prowess or his lord\u2019s displeasure is enough to avert a disruptive conflict completely. History relates a widely debated episode involving a mysterious golden statue that numerous modern theologians identify as the herald of God of Law.","According to writings, in the fearful night prior to what seemed to be an inevitable slave revolt, a massive and magnificent statue appeared upon one of the hills overlooking the city. Holding a gigantic hammer and posed as if ready to smite the city, the mysterious statue bore the symbol of the God of Law upon its breast, looming like some divine threat. The figure baffled slave and master alike, ultimately leading many of the superstitious rebels to reconsider their murderous uprising. The mysterious statue disappeared four nights later, but within a week\u2019s time savage hordes from the west sought to raze the city. The city barely resisted, winning a costly victory that would have been unimaginable in the wake of a crippling internal revolt.","On several occasions, followers of the god of law have reported seeing the Herald wandering remote places, from ancient caves to deep underwater trenches, seemingly searching for something. Neither God of Law nor the golden titan ever speak of these travels, leading to widespread conjecture and debate among the faith."]},"herald":{"title":"herald","spell":[],"description":["This creature appears to be a gigantic pale yellow-green frog with oversized monstrous eyes.

It may in fact have once been an actual storm given independent life and intelligence, but it does not remember anything before its awakening.

It remains neutral in the dealings of various planar entities, and sometimes acts as an intermediary between rival forces\u2014but only in direct, blunt, and expedient way, for it is a creature of force and action, not gentle diplomacy. Its actions have attracted a small number of sycophants and refugees from the elemental wars, air and water elementals tired of battle and looking for other ways to fill their immortal lives; these creatures follow Fury and allow it to summon them, and in faithful service to it they allow mortals to summon them.

It sometimes forgets its own strength, and may accidentally crush, freeze, or electrocute nearby creatures and objects\u2014 its errant bolts of lightning have started many forest fires. It is amoral in this destruction, just as it is in any help it unintentionally provides. Certain magical pools, springs, and streams in the mortal realm may be inadvertent manifestations of its presence, changing the ecology of the region where they appear for hundreds or thousands of years. ","Fury has no urge to reproduce or create more of its kind; interacting with its minions and mortal worshipers is the closest it comes to familial interests.","On the rare occasions when one of its elementals is permanently slain, it has been known to grieve for years, becoming more withdrawn and prone to outbursts, though its attitude is more that of a creature who has lost a pet than that of someone who has lost a friend or relative. When it finishes grieving, it usually travels to the Plane of Air or Plane of Water, working with the lords there in hopes of finding another like-minded minor elemental minion who may replace the one who was lost. Because the herald can recover from almost any injury as long as a small portion of it remains, some elementals wandering the Material Plane may actually be derived from its substance, cleaved off in some mighty battle and only becoming self-aware after gathering sufficient air or water\u2014though they would not recognize any kinship."]},"Steward":{"title":"Steward","spell":["detect chaos\/evil\/good\/law","detect chaos\/evil\/good\/law","augury","cure light wounds","dancing lights","death ward","detect thoughts","disguise self","major image","greater teleport","breath of life","chain lightning","globe of invulnerability","greater dispel magic","greater invisibility","heal","hold monster","limited wish","plane shift","undeath to death","wall of force","consecrate"],"description":["The Steward of the Skein is a mighty warrior sent to restore the balance of fate, announce a particularly auspicious birth or death, or deliver a world-shaking prophecy.

Their souls return to the world of the living demanding justice, revenge, or just wanton destruction. Some dead, however, never intended for their souls to leave. Instead they wished to preserve their knowledge, their culture, or some other aspect of their life in an undying form that could forever accumulate more of the same. In these instances, where lichdom is not sought as a viable option, and a multitude of individuals wish to take part, the result can be a charnel colossus.","A charnel colossus is an amalgam of scores, even hundreds, of individuals who, upon death, chose to be interred under special ritual circumstances with others of like mind. This allowed them to feed their individual life experiences into an undying corporation of the collective whole. The resulting monstrosity would be like a living library\u2013if it were living. The individual will of the deceased participants is subsumed in favor of a hive-like personality composed of all of the knowledge and experiences of the individual contributors. A few dominant or powerful members of this amalgam may give the resulting combined creature a general style of behavior, but no single constituent provides the creature with a true guiding force. Instead, the result is a pooling of the wisdom and experience of those who have been so interred\u2013often over a period spanning hundreds of years\u2013creating an abomination whose sole focus is the perpetuation of any such cultural traditions and the acquisition of more constituent parts to ever expand its breadth of experience. It is this guiding gluttony for further expansion of consciousness that ensures that even the most benign of traditions or experiential pools from which a charnel colossus is formed inevitably results in an all-consuming horror.","The charnel colossus is a mass of the corpses that form its composition, often intermixed with earth, broken grave goods, and other burial materials if the decayed bodies alone are insufficient to fill out its massive size. This amorphous whole is collected within a membrane through which the individual corpses can still be seen and against which they often press as if seeking their freedom. But when a creature becomes trapped in the embrace of a colossus, the membrane proves to be permeable\u2013the rotten, lipless mouths of those so interred are able to reach forth and feed upon the victim\u2019s own life experience.
