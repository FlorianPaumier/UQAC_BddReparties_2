Though eerily similar to humans, elves, and the other mammalian humanoids, Triaxians have developed certain adaptations to their environment that mark them as indisputably alien.<\/br>Just like human ethnicities, Triaxian populations vary in size, weight, and other distinguishing physical characteristics, based primarily on the geographical regions in which they reside. Most Triaxians, both males and females, are around 6 feet tall but somewhat lean compared to humans, rarely weighing more than 200 pounds. Their ears are elongated, but rather than being pointed like elves or half lings, these appendages are instead notched in a feathered or comb-like pattern. The flaps created by these notches constantly move to adjust the ear\u2019s shape, operating both consciously and unconsciously to help Triaxians focus on specific sounds, not unlike the maneuverable ears of dogs, cats, and other such animals.<\/br>Like many creatures on their world, Triaxians have evolved to shift along with their environment, resulting in differences between generations of the same family that would seem bizarre to humanoids.

This configuration allows them to better survive in the sweltering heat of the planet\u2019s tropical summers, with the increased melanin in their dark skin protecting them from the sun\u2019s intense rays.

Newborn Triaxians begin to evince new adaptations to the cooling environment, and by the time winter has come on in full, Triaxians change markedly: their pale bodies are covered in fine, insulating white fur like that of an ermine, while their eyes narrow to elongated slits to protect against snow blindness. These new traits similarly breed true until the seasons begin to change once more, at which point the eyes widen and fur recedes, starting the cycle anew.<\/br>Just as Triaxians differ physically depending on which season they\u2019re born into, so do their cultures and customs change. Winterborn Triaxians are defined by the hardship of a world whose very environment seeks to starve or freeze them. They tend to be stolid, hardworking people, with an ironclad sense of honor stemming from the knowledge that in a Triaxian winter, a broken promise can mean death for a whole clan. Even within large communities, the focus remains on survival for one\u2019s family and friends, with individuals willing and ready to share, serve, and die to protect the group. Oaths of friendship are serious affairs; once given they are rarely transgressed, and doing so risks a blood feud. With the exception of those nomadic hunter tribes that migrate in pursuit of herd animals, most settlements are permanent and fortified against the predatory horrors that stalk the blinding blizzards. Summerborn Triaxians, by contrast, are born into a world of plenty. With forests full of fruit and game, and glaciers receding to reveal vast tracts of fertile earth, the attachment to cold stone fortresses and cramped cities weakens, and Triaxians spread out across the landscape. For many, it is a time of nomadism, living in small bands and temporary structures, or else participating in great waves of land-grabs as homesteaders. Though they still have the weight of history to remind them of the hardships of their ancestors\u2014and those yet to come for their descendants\u2014Summerborn Triaxians tend to be an easy-going, generous people, quick to accept outsiders, to break with their clans and families and strike out on their own, and to challenge convention in pursuit of greater goals. They are simultaneously less hardened and more likely to go to war, for with the business of survival taking less energy and new territory constantly being settled, leaders have more time and resources to dispute borders and jockey for power. Historically, Summerborn Triaxians are those most likely to visit other planes or worlds, as the drive to explore their newly thawed planet also leads them to look beyond it.<\/br>Transitional Triaxians occupy a much smaller portion of the Triaxian adaptation cycle than either the Summerborn or Winterborn\u2014usually no more than a generation each orbital year\u2014and often play an uncomfortable role in their society. To Summerborn Triaxians, a Transitional child is an ill omen\u2014a sign that winter approaches, and that the time of plenty is drawing to a close. The first such individuals to appear are often hidden or slain by their parents, and vilified by those rebellious fools and leaders who believe that Transitional children actively bring on the winter, or who simply don\u2019t want to begin the long and arduous process of preparing for future generations\u2019 survival. Transitional children born at the tail of winter, on the other hand, are often treasured and held up as hopeful signs of a golden era to come. Yet even these may face persecution by those dynasties that fear change, or whose leaders expect a loss of power once their people are free to spread beyond their reach. In both cases, Transitional Triaxians find themselves in a society where they are visibly different from both their parents and their children, and where their very existence is a weighty portent. Strangely, while Triaxians\u2019 mutable nature is perfectly adapted to their planet\u2019s erratic orbit, the cycle of physiological changes seems keyed to internal clocks rather than external indicators. Even in situations where these adaptations would be disadvantageous, the small populations of Triaxians who have set up residence on other worlds or planes continue to change in time with their kindred. Beyond their obvious adaptations to their environment, Triaxians are remarkably human. Their basic biology, social structures, cultures, and philosophy\u2014while sometimes surprising to outsiders\u2014all fall well within the bounds of what might be encountered in a humanoid race, thus making them one of the least \u201calien\u201d civilizations in the solar system.<\/br>Though the statistics above represent a typical initiate training to become a dragon rider, this is by no means the standard for the race\u2014outside of broad strokes, it\u2019s as impossible to describe Triaxians\u2019 myriad traits and predispositions as it would be to do so for humanity itself. Triaxians are good and evil, warlike and peaceful, magical and mundane, and everything in between.

Some planar scholars believe that these miniature genies are portions of the planes that have grown sentience and broken off from the elemental fabric.

Still others claim that a zhyen is created when a powerful genie desires a thinking, agreeable companion, not unlike the means by which human mages craft homunculi.<\/br>In truth, zhyen arise from all of these methods. Whatever the engine behind its creation, a zhyen appears fully formed and coherent, taking only minutes to acclimate to its surrounds and learn what\u2019s needed of it.

Zhyen dislike such treatment, but given their relative weakness compared to other genies, they are unable to alter their status.<\/br>Occasionally, a zhyen summoned to the Material Plane is astounded by the diverse wonders of the mortal world, and seeks to return. Such zhyen respond to summonings and callings as often as possible, and may eventually seek to join the world entirely as a familiar to a daivrat.

After their prey has fallen to the pain of a dozen such wounds, clawbats land and vigorously lap up their meal until their bellies are bloated with gore. aiding clawbats in their hunts is their acrid saliva, a stinging milky-white fluid that possesses an anticoagulant quality, causing their bites to leave messy wounds that bleed until treated. This effect allows clawbats to <\/br>Clawbat eyes are exceedingly abnormal, being nearly flat, yet still functional. As the creatures\u2019 eyes are set upon their wings, the constant flapping gives the clawbats a constantly shifting view of the area around them, but particularly the land below\u2014an experience which would seem terribly jarring to any creature not used to the experience. The eyes are one-sided, occupying only the inner part of their thick, fleshy wings, and are lidless, being constantly watered by ducts surrounding each eye. The profuse watering of these organs causes clawbats to fling a fine spray as they move, which often serves as a victim\u2019s first warning of impending danger.<\/br>Other flying creatures, such as hawks, eagles, and owls, make up the clawbats\u2019 natural predators. The sounds of these raptors can dissuade clawbats from attacking, even in the midst of a feeding frenzy, and will send them winging straight for their roost to avoid attack. Giant centipedes occasionally invade clawbat lairs, crawling up the wall or waiting for their prey at the exit. Clawbats have little natural defense against creatures with thick exoskeletons and avoid them when it is possible to attack an easier source of food. Clawbats can live up to 20 years, though most die earlier due to predation, accidents, or infighting.<\/br>Clawbats are found far from heavily civilized lands, though whether this is due to civilized efforts to stamp them out or because they prefer distant, half-wild places is open to debate. They live in clutches of up to 15 members, favoring dark places that offer easy aerial access to the outside world. Each of these places must have a roost that allows the creatures to drop the 15 feet necessary to begin flying; if a stationary clawbat attempts to start flying without sufficient drop, it glides to the ground and must mount to a higher point before it can launch again. This makes them skittish in claustrophobic spaces, for they do not like to be at a disadvantage, and this in turn leads them to infest places such as ruined structures, large, open caves, and fissures. New clutches of clawbats contain 4 to 6 young members, which depart a clutch once it has grown to exceed 15 members. The young fly 10 to 15 miles away, searching for a suitable structure or crag to shield them during the day. Once a group of clawbats leaves its original home, the members feel no loyalty to their former family and compete fiercely for resources. On numerous occasions, mages, druids, and barbarians shamans have attempted to capture and train clawbats. While the creatures\u2019 awkwardness once they are brought to ground makes them relatively easy to capture\u2014though frustratingly difficult to restrain given their flexibility and many squirming limbs\u2014 no documented attempt to train the beasts has ever succeeded. Even efforts paired with steady diets of blood typically end in the clawbat attacking its keeper just as often as availing themselves of the easier food source. This, and their regular attempts to feed even when critically wounded, have won the creatures a reputation for being dumbly vicious, a reputation that leads most thinking creatures to curse and move quickly to exterminate any clawbats that appear in their lands."},"Cooshee":{"name":"Cooshee","spell":[],"description":"This creature appears as a large green and brown spotted dog with slightly elven features.

They are so rare, in fact, that most people believe their existence to be only legend. At first sight, many adventurers assume that ubues are a race of three-headed ettins or trolls. Adventurers who have actually seen these strange creatures claim that the middle head of an ubue is a different sex from the other two.

If twins are born to an ubue couple, this is seen as an ill omen: thus, one child is slain by the tribal shaman as a sacrifice to their god.

In her effort to advance the phase spiders\u2019 eternal war effort against the xill, the mistress of the colony conceived a grand experiment: Rather than hunting for the food they required, her colony could farm it, keeping living captives as a constantly replenishing feast and giving themselves more time to focus on strategy. Unlucky humans, harvested surreptitiously from all corners of the globe, proved a perfect fit. As the phase spiders carried new victims into the Ethereal Plane, the mistress bound them into the ethereal webs of the colony, her peerless control over the ether changing the humans\u2019 flesh wherever it touched and making them an inextricable part of her growing menagerie.<\/br>In this manner, hundreds of humans were literally woven into the spun ether-web substance of the colony\u2019s holdings, with tiny filaments permeating every pore and orifice. Nourished by the same magic that bound them, the humans were bled with numbing monotony, feeding the cave spiders with their vital fluids. Disconnected from the world in the eternal half-light of the Ethereal Plane, with no companions but the alien whisperings of their spider hosts and the muffled screams and moans of their fellow survivors (or new captives brought to the colony to replace those whose bodies failed them), one by one the humans went mad. The phase spiders were without malice or cruelty, but few of their captives could cling long to rationality in the face of the incessant degradations and skittering ministrations of the eight-legged captors who tended them like livestock.<\/br>Through unnumbered years, the colony continued to grow, and the humans who endured soon found that they did not age and die as quickly as they once did. The dilated reality of the Ethereal Plane had infused their flesh, with spun ether and skin becoming one. It was only when a skirmish with the xill went poorly and brought the war itself that the phase spiders were forced to abandon their colony\u2014and their chattel. Though many of the phase spiders escaped, their mistress was destroyed. Her final act was the creation of a pyrrhic cyclone of ether that obliterated both her and the opposing forces, but also tore the colony\u2019s livestock loose and scattered them across the planes. Though the surviving phase spiders remembered their leader\u2019s lofty idea, none possessed the power to manipulate the ether to bind and sustain humans, and over time all memory of the experiment was lost.<\/br>Yet the human captives scattered by the ether cyclone were not completely destroyed. Though many met their ends on inhospitable planes, roasted in the Plane of Fire or tortured in the pits of Hell, a few found themselves back on the Material Plane\u2014and possessed of unnerving new abilities. Tendrils of wispy ether-stuff remained fused with their once smooth skin, forming a ragged mass of gauzy strips that hung loosely about them and proved strangely adherent to the dense reality of the Material Plane. These new creatures\u2014for no longer could they reasonably be called humans\u2014also slowly realized that their lifespans had lengthened, and the normal aging that should have taken years now stretched into decades.<\/br>Yet with these changes came something else: a hunger like nothing they had ever known, bred into them by the strange sustenance of the Weavemistress. A hunger, not of their own digestive systems, but rather an urge to feed some half-heard and only barely understood longing within the depths of their subconscious\u2014a need to feel the fresh, warm blood of living creatures flowing over their grasping hands and waving tendrils. Whatever longing the prisoners may have had to return to their former lives quickly eroded in the face of that strange, all-consuming directive.<\/br>Stripped of their humanity, the adherers embraced their bizarre new forms. And they began to hunt.<\/br>Adherers are basically humanoid in size and build, though with pallid and hairless skin that hangs loosely on their gaunt bodies. During their captivity, the adherers\u2019 physiology was subtly altered, allowing their flesh and skin to engorge and distend\u2014the better to store fresh blood\u2014and their skin retains baggy folds even though their flesh has withdrawn. Even newborn adherers share this trait, as the ethereal filaments permeate even their parents\u2019 wombs, weaving themselves into the flesh of the adherers\u2019 offspring and ready for use from the moment of birth.<\/br>The psychoactive ether-filaments that once bound them to the colony have also become inextricably woven into every nerve and organ, and it is principally the filaments\u2019 influence\u2014still driving them to acquire blood for their long-dead captors\u2014that leads the crazed adherers to prey on other intelligent creatures. Once an instrument of bondage and subtle life-force manipulation, these ether-filaments now grow from the adherers, weaving themselves together into cloth-like bands. While adherers\u2019 heads usually remain nearly bald, the rest of their bodies are draped and shrouded with these loose-hanging filament bands, creating their mummy-like appearance. These filaments are coated in a faintly damp, flammable residue that has a potent sour stench like curdling milk, a clue to those familiar with them that hidden adherers may be nearby.<\/br>Adherer filaments are bonded to the creatures\u2019 neural structures, bringing excruciating pain to those adherers who have tried to cut them off. However, the strands also respond to their thoughts, and are incredibly adherent to matter from the Material Plane. It was not long after their escape that hungry adherers discovered the filaments made excellent tools for attaching camouflage to themselves or catching and binding elusive prey. As their filaments frayed and were shed, cannier adherers began to harvest this detritus, weaving it into tools to help them capture others and drain them of their blood. In the moldering recesses of their filament-wracked minds, they strive to carry on the legacy of the captors that once held them, though with a measure of cruelty and relish unprecedented by the phase spiders.<\/br>Adherers can survive as scavengers, but crave the sensation of trapping another creature and repeatedly draining its blood. Lacking the expertise or intellect of their captors, however, adherers tend to err on the side of taking too much, so their captives rarely last long. Though adherers occasionally drink the shed blood, more often they simply collect it out of habit, storing it in vats, jugs, and bottles. Those exploring adherer lairs are likely to find many such containers, cold and congealed.<\/br>Adherers are male or female, like humans, and procreate in the usual fashion, save that they join their filaments into a cocoon during copulation. They weave similar constructions out of dead fibers to keep their young safe while the parents hunt. While they rarely have the opportunity\u2014as their lust for blood generally overcomes all others\u2014adherers are also capable of interbreeding with humans. The resulting abominations appear human at birth, but quickly change as the ether filaments multiply and spring from their skins. Within less than a year, the children are transformed in both body and mind into infant adherers.<\/br>Adherers on the Material Plane have a lifespan approximately twice that of an ordinary human. Young and old must hunt as long as they are able, and those nearing the end of their lives often seek the most dangerous duties, craving death as an alternative to burdening the nest. Adherer dead are cocooned in their own filaments and woven into the walls of their community.<\/br>In combat, adherers naturally gravitate toward melee, where they use their adhesive qualities to crush their opponents to them, binding them in strands of sticky, extruded filaments and leaving them alive for later bloodletting whenever possible. The stickiness of their skin also makes them adept at disarming their foes, making melee weapons a risky option for those facing them. If confronted with enemies who can\u2019t be subdued easily through simple grappling and adhesion, adherers are smart enough to slink into the shadows and set up elaborate ambushes.<\/br>The original adherers found their homeworld frighteningly unpredictable after their years of regimented imprisonment. In the moldering depths of their sanity, they dimly remembered their names and homes, and sought to find help from their friends and descendants. Those humans they met, however, saw only staggering, moaning abominations covered in bandages and refuse, stuttering in the inhuman cadences of an alien tongue. Fear and revulsion turned to violent reprisal, and the ether-gauze bands of the adherers proved just as flammable as the wraps of the mummies they resembled.<\/br>Fleeing back into dark and wild places, the adherers bitterly realized there was no place for them in human society. Yet this was not merely the result of prejudice on the part of their human brethren\u2014for with every passing moment, the adherers found themselves more and more starved for the release of bloodletting, and needing to appease the obsession of the tendrils in their brains. With primitive malice, they recreated the only society they knew anymore, one of captivity, slavery, and slow consumption. Not blood-drinkers like their arachnid captors, adherers simply consume their bound prisoners one bite at a time, clubbing victims into unconsciousness if their screams grow too loud, but always awakening them on schedule for feeding and bloodletting.<\/br>Adherers often choose to live underground or in heavily vegetated terrain, where they can find or manufacture cover and concealing shrouds for their nests and ambushes. Their favored lairs, however, are ruined or abandoned buildings whose original inhabitants have been exterminated.<\/br>Adherers are cruel stalkers and ambushers, with a debased intellect scarcely above that of a particularly clever and ruthless animal. They exhibit a feral cunning in setting up ambushes, but their society is little more than a brutish pack ruled by the strongest, cleverest, or most vicious adherer in the nest. Dominant adherers control breeding in the nest and select the choicest captives for their feasting, sometimes casting out those who would challenge their authority. Those adherers unable to claim power and unwilling to serve beneath the dominant member sometimes voluntarily leave in order to start their own nests (a process that frequently involves restraining their bloodlust long enough to mate with captives and produce a new generation of nestmates). Adherers are constantly driven by their hunger, and even those able to converse with them in Aklo find them barely able to hold a conversation. The only creatures that seem to enjoy the company of adherers are spiders, who sometimes sense an affinity of sorts within them. Some sages speculate that the ectoplasmic secretions of an adherer\u2019s filament-bonds act as a pheromone that attracts spiders to them. What is known is that spiders will not attack adherers unless magically controlled, and some adherers have still greater empathic abilities with arachnids.<\/br>Adherers make excellent and atmospheric villains, representing an enemy that is both familiar in its nearhumanity and yet wholly alien. They can be placed into ordinary cave complexes, tombs, or other adventure locations, but are used to best effect when haunting ruined villages or cities draped with clinging webs and strands. Adherers are cleverer than animals\u2014if only just\u2014and able to set up ambushes, entangling and separating their foes to gang up on lone targets. They can be paired with spiders, ettercaps, and similar creatures, complementing one another\u2019s modes of hunting.<\/br>At the same time, adherers are only barely sentient, just enough to convey a sense of tragic loss and hunger. Their moaning and chattering might at first appear to be akin to the guttural groaning of zombies, but it should be discernible to any paying attention that it is actual (if alien) speech, with a desperate edge of wanting and pain. The notion of being taken and exsanguinated by a nest of adherers (when their true nature is known) should be plenty to inspire dread, and any sage capable of recognizing the monsters should be able to inform the PCs that a captured NPC ally may face far worse if the adherer is attempting to start a new nest and seeking hosts for its corrupted seed\u2026<\/br>Because of their resemblance to mummies, adherers can be used to turn PC expectations on their heads, giving birth to local rumors that lead PCs to stock up on resources to fight undead, only to find them ineffective against the true horrors they face. Still, adherers\u2019 <\/br>Some adherers lost their structural framework as their human tissue dissolved completely, leaving only a shapeless mass of ragged, fibrous swathes in which their frayed consciousness lingers. A shroud appears to be a pile of cobwebs and detritus when still, but when attacking unfurls into a wide, tattered sheet, often forming a crude face from the gaps and rents in the tissue.<\/br>Adherer shrouds share the normal abilities of their kind, but they have a fly speed of 20 (average maneuverability) and gain an additional +4 bonus on <\/br>An adherer shroud wraps itself entirely around a target that it grapples.

Certain rare adherers, however, weave their shed ectoplasmic strands into a silken material, working it into simple garments or elaborate macram\u00e9 decorated with sparkling crystals or coins to catch and reflect the light, reminding them of the glittering and ethereal vastness that was once their home. Once their adherer creator has died, rendering the silk harmless, these clinging garments can be extremely valuable to the right buyer, and silk from an adherer can sell for 10 times the price of the normal variety."},"Adaro":{"name":"Adaro","spell":[],"description":"Malevolent denizens of the waters, adaros are among the fiercest sentient hunters of the tropical seas.

Adaros usually eat once every couple of days, gorging on meals half their weight.<\/br>Adaros mate with other members of their tribe only briefly; females spawn four to seven eggs, which males fertilize. Both female and male adaros understand the purpose of procreating to be solely to sustain the tribe, and thus develop no feelings for one another or their offspring. They tend to make nests within aquatic caverns or small stone and coral structures on the seafloor some distance from the shore, to better ensure the survival of their brood when they hatch. Gestation usually takes only 2 to 3 months, and it takes about 10 years for adaros to fully mature, during which time they hunt fish or other oceanic animals until they are capable of taking down greater prey. Adaros rarely live for more than 25 to 30 years because of their violent lifestyle, but truly powerful individuals have been known to live for half a century.<\/br>Adaros\u2019 strange relationship with storms has mesmerized and intrigued scholars for centuries. These sea-dwellers have an especial connection to the deadly creatures of the water and the wildness of foul weather, and it is not by coincidence that they attack humanoids more often during rough seas. Adaros universally worship the deity of the sea and weather, and fly into a frenzy when the rain clouds overhead become dark and let loose their tears. One of the more accepted theories regarding adaros\u2019 connection with the rain suggests that the hunters of the sea are manifested from the chaos of the Winds and Waves in some distant ocean beyond the horizon. When it rains, the bond between the two aspects strengthens and drives adaros into a fury akin to the storm that initiated the turbulence. <\/br>Adaros are semi-nomadic by nature; tribes travel until they find a suitable hunting ground, and leave either when their presence becomes too well known or when their game runs low. Although they have been seen on the high seas, the wandering tribes tend to stay close to shore, sometimes venturing out to raid ships leaving nearby ports. Having stealthily trailed behind a vessel for miles, waiting to strike until the boat and its passengers are too far from shore to receive immediate aid, a band of adaros swiftly and without warning attacks those onboard. Depending on the size of the ship, any number of adaros might participate in this raid, from a single hunter to dozens. The water-dwelling predators choose their targets carefully and strategically.<\/br>This is not to say those onshore are safe from the well-aimed spears of adaros. Small portside towns suffer from the occasional adaro attack, their unprotected docks easy targets for lone adaros. Larger cities have also seen their fair share of the aquatic hunters, as bands of adaros assail unwary dockworkers or any who visit the beach past dusk.<\/br>The commonality between all places adaros gravitate toward, however, is the weather. Adaros live only in waters that experience rain at least semi-frequently, and so are rarely found in such places as desert-lined coasts or frozen, arctic waters. During the rainy season, adaros behave in an almost completely different manner than usual, their tactical nature overrun by primal instinct and bloodlust. When the weather gets rough, adaros lose their inhibitions and thirst only for another kill, but it is universally understood that killing an adaro within one\u2019s own tribe is strictly taboo, and is punished by death with almost no exceptions.<\/br>Adaros usually live in tribes of no more than 100 individuals. Members observe no set hierarchy\u2014rather, they gain esteem and honor in their small societies by taking down particularly hardy or large victims. When two tribes encounter each other, there is usually a mutual understanding that the tribe that first came to the territory in question has rightful claim to it. When feuds do arise, however, they have occasionally turned into wars\u2014especially if such confrontations occur during rainfall\u2014leaving many fallen adaros to wash up on the nearby shore at the end of the bloody battle.<\/br>Originating from Solomon Island mythology, adaros are thought to be the evil aspect of a human\u2019s soul, manifested in the form of half-fish, half-human sea spirits that live on the sun and travel to Earth via rainbows. From these prismatic bridges, adaros hurl poisoned sawfish at fishers or sailors, knocking their victims unconscious or killing them. In mythology, the adaro has a shark-fin horn, as well as a spearfish-like spike growing out of the back of its head, and at times, these sea spirits visit people in their dreams, teaching them new songs and dances."},"Agogwe":{"name":"Agogwe","spell":[],"description":"Agogwe are capricious little hominids.

These remarkable plants can see minute movements in the earth and air and detect changes in light and heat through their broad leaves, giving them exceptional awareness of the area around them. Possessing no intelligence or agenda, they lash out at whatever living things pass nearby, regardless of the target\u2019s size, sentience, or potential deadliness. A mature plant consists of a main vine, about 20 feet long; smaller vines up to 5 feet long branch off from the main vine about every 6 inches. These small vines bear clusters of leaves, and in late summer they produce bunches of small fruits that resemble wild blackberries. The fruit is tough and has a hearty and typically bitter flavor, although some say the berries change in taste depending on what victims composted a given plant\u2019s roots. The most murderous assassin vines supposedly produce the sweetest berries. <\/br>An assassin vine can move about, but usually stays put unless it needs to seek prey in a new vicinity. The plants use simple tactics, lying still until prey comes within reach and then attacking. Once an assassin vine is engaged, it pursues prey (albeit slowly) in order to catch and compost the creature. The plants prove tenacious, as long as their quarry remains within sight. Once a creature moves beyond the plant\u2019s ability to perceive it, the unthinking vine falls still and lies in wait for the next passerby. <\/br>Assassin vines lurk within dense forests and swamps, but some might encroach upon poorly tended fields and vineyards. The vine\u2019s seeds might be spread far by birds swift enough to pluck them and escape.

Averaging 7 feet tall and weighing roughly 300 pounds, a female ceratioidi\u2019s fleshy body belies both its tremendous strength and its startling intelligence. Males, though equally intelligent, appear to outside observers to be nothing more than fish with vaguely anthropomorphic faces. Born from ribbon-like egg clusters, ceratioidi mature quickly and are ready to mate when 1 year old. During the mating ritual, the tiny male ceratioidi affixes itself to the back of a female\u2019s neck and begins secreting an enzyme that dissolves both creatures\u2019 skin and transforms them into a single unit. Within a few weeks, what was two creatures has become one\u2014though each retains its own independent consciousness, the male joins his respiration, digestion, and other biological functions with those of the female, becoming nothing more than a bulging organ on his partner\u2019s back. While unintelligent angler fish use similar methods in order to self-fertilize at will, a ceratioidi male retains independent thought, and the two linked entities remain in constant telepathic communication, using their combined mental faculties to excel at wizardry and maintain absolute physical precision in combat. This uniquely divided mental structure also makes it easy for ceratioidi to study multiple fields or callings, such as the powerful witch\/wizard combination that is their trademark, though it\u2019s also common for them to act as underwater rangers. <\/br> In addition to their dual nature, ceratioidi share a number of other intimidating characteristics with their angler fish cousins. Along with its wide mouth full of inward-curving, needle-sharp teeth, a ceratioidi also possesses the angler fish\u2019s fleshy forehead lure, called an esca. This bioluminescent blob dangles at the end of thin spine just above eye level and is the focus for the ceratioidi\u2019s innate hypnotic abilities. Through this lure, the ceratioidi can paralyze foes in combat, forcing them to stand still or approach and be culled by the ceratioidi\u2019s barbed fishing spear; it can even hypnotize creatures so thoroughly as to make them susceptible to subliminal commands. This ability to manipulate others, combined with the immobile male\u2019s natural affinity for magical study and other deeply contemplative arts, makes the ceratioidi masters of their surroundings. <\/br> Though almost all ceratioidi encountered outside of their homes are fully mated pairs, unmated females can be represented by removing the dual mind ability from the creature\u2019s stat block.

"},"Drekavac":{"name":"Drekavac","spell":[" gaseous form","remove curse","remove disease","remove curse","remove disease"],"description":"Drekavacs are the undead remains of children who perished from disease, particularly in plague-ridden areas where many such deaths occurred in a short period of time. Able to become as insubstantial as the mist rising from a graveyard on a cold, dark night, drekavacs are carriers of disease, seeking to infect the living with the afflictions that slew them. According to some stories, drekavacs only result from young plague victims who remain unburied or died bereft of the proper funeral rites; performing those rites may allow their spirits to rest and no longer haunt the world of the living.<\/br>Drekavacs typically haunt desolate places, from windswept plains and mountains to dark forests and abandoned homes or villages. They may move among inhabited areas in gaseous form, but are typically warded off by bright lights and the sounds and sights of life. They are always encountered indoors or at night, preferring dark, cloudy or foggy nights, ideally during the waning moon. Drekavacs are usually encountered during the gloomy, cold winter months rather than in the spring or summer. Rural clerics and adepts must sometimes deal with one or more drekavacs seeking to spread disease in their communities. Their favored targets are children, some of whom can also become drekavacs 3 days after death unless their bodies are burned and the ashes scattered. The work of drekavacs in a community can sometimes lead to hysterical accusations by grief-stricken parents and families, stirring up resentment and violence toward outsiders or anyone suspected of involvement with unnatural forces. It is customary in some rural areas to surround a child\u2019s crib with a ring of blessed salt to keep evil influences at bay, including drekavacs, who cannot cross an unbroken line of salt. However, drekavacs can convince others to break the line of salt for them.<\/br>Drekavacs are lonesome, bitter, and pitiful creatures, often crying when they appear, mourning their lost lives. Some folk mistake them for living children, lost or starving, although the creatures are not very effective liars. Still, a dim night and a half-seen form huddled and sobbing pitifully are often enough to trick someone into approaching close enough to become victim of the drekavac\u2019s chilling grasp.<\/br>Once they have inflicted their plagues upon victims, drekavacs quickly lose interest and move on, although they may follow a victim, begging for aid and attention, behaving as if they were still living victims of disease rather than its agents. They rarely kill victims outright, preferring instead to inflict long and lingering deaths through disease. Drekavacs threatened with salt, magic, or silver weapons become vicious, attacking opponents like snarling dogs until they are dead or the creatures are driven off. Drekavacs sometimes band together in small packs, particularly in places where epidemics or plagues have swept through a population, either recently or long ago, but they have no real organization beyond seeking out new victims to infect. Drekavacs are intelligent and aware, able to converse in Common, or whatever languages they knew in life. This means some drekavacs are only able to communicate in largely dead or forgotten languages. They are childlike in their understanding and largely incapable of being reasoned with, but deft use of Bluff or Diplomacy and a playful or parental tone may keep a drekavac at bay, at least temporarily.<\/br>In Slavic myth and folklore, drekavacs are the souls of unbaptized children, not necessarily victims of disease, although they were often said to be. They are known for their horrifying cries, and descriptions of their appearance vary widely, some looking like thin, emaciated children, others having animal heads, fur, or bird-like features. The most common way of exorcising them was believed to be a rite of baptism performed on the creature, its corpse, or grave. Believers say the touch of a drekavac\u2019s shadow causes illness and disease in anyone unfortunate enough to encounter the creature. A home around which a drekavac cried and wailed was destined to have someone die there soon, and drekavacs were said to return to haunt the dreams of those who had done evil, particularly to children. The spirit of a child killed by its parents (from abuse or neglect) was likely to return as a drekavac, either to seek vengeance or to accuse them with its cries until they repented and confessed what they had done."},"Drow":{"name":"Drow","spell":["sleep","detect magic","dancing lights","deeper darkness","faerie fire","feather fall","levitate","divine favor","dispel magic","suggestion","death knell","hold person","silence","bless","cause fear","cure light wounds","protection from law","bleed","detect poison","read magic","resistance","invisibility","dispel magic","cure light wounds","dancing lights","deeper darkness","faerie fire","feather fall","levitate","detect magic","divine favor","dispel magic","suggestion"],"description":"Drow nobles are defined by their class levels\u2014they do not possess racial <\/br>ECOLOGY<\/br>About one out of every 20 drow is gifted with special powers from birth\u2014the overwhelming majority of these exceptional drow are female, and as a result, drow society tends to be matriarchal in nature.

Known for their magic-warping shells, flail snails roam slowly through subterranean caverns writing great epics in their slime trails.<\/br>Of all the bizarre creatures that haunt the caves and crevasses of the subterranean world, the flail snail is one of the strangest. As slow for its size as its diminutive cousins, the flail snail fears little from underground predators, thanks to its nigh-impermeable armor and the powerful, mace-like pseudopods that give it its name. Yet the most curious trait of this docile denizen lies is in the singular properties of its shell, which not only defends the creature against magic, but is capable of warping spells and flinging them back at their caster.<\/br>Slow and easily avoidable due to their telltale slime trails, flail snails tend to be peaceful unless actively threatened or approached too closely. At these times, the sedately waving tentacles on the creature\u2019s head become an intricately woven blur, the horn-like growths at their tips whistling as they\u2019re flung with terrific force by long strands of muscle. Each swipe of these biological flails is capable of staving in a man\u2019s chest, and though most creatures have plenty of time to retreat, those who press their luck or run afoul of the flail snail\u2019s mucilaginous secretions come out the other side as a red smear on the cavern floor.<\/br>The average flail snail stands 8 feet high at the top of its shell and 12 feet long, though the highly elastic nature of its flesh allows it to stretch out much farther. When threatened by an opponent not easily dispatched by its whirling tentacles, the flail snail can retract its entire body into its massive spiral shell, plugging the opening with its four rock-hard flails. These shells are frequently streaked with bright colors in patterns that differ between individuals; older snails tend to have larger shells with more elaborate markings, some of which may appear to resemble runes or symbols. Adult flail snails can weigh several thousand pounds, yet thanks to their slime they still manage to cling perfectly to the stone floors, walls, and even ceilings where they graze, feeding their prodigious bulk on fields of fungus, mold, and vermin. Though they have occasionally been known to consume carrion and the corpses of creatures they kill, this is generally believed to be due to lack of discrimination rather than malice, with the snail simply eating whatever it passes over out of habit.<\/br>Physically, flail snails differ from their lesser kindred only in their size, magical shells, and powerful antennae. Movement is achieved via a single enormous foot that takes up most of the underside of the snail\u2019s body and pulls it along by expanding and contracting in muscular ripples aided by slimy secretions. Most of the snail\u2019s day is spent eating with the help of a radula, a long ribbon of tongue studded with thousands of tiny tooth-like structures that act like a rasp, scraping organic matter from the stone and shredding it into pieces for digestion. The constant need to eat leads the snails to migrate frequently, either alone or in slow-moving colonies called routs, and any cavern or dungeon with sufficient organic matter growing on the walls is prime real estate to a flail snail, regardless of what any other inhabitants might think.<\/br>Like other slugs and snails, the tentacle-like protrusions on the flail snail\u2019s head are its primary sensory organs, with the top pair sensing light and the lower providing the sense of smell and handling most tactile and fine manipulation duties. Both pairs can be retracted up to the horny growths at the end, and regrow in a month if lost. Even without these sensors, the snail can still move about reasonably well, as its suction with the ground allows it to sense its surroundings via tremors in the rock. This is especially useful since striking out with its powerful flails leads to them being easily damaged in combat.<\/br>Though the flail snail\u2019s shell gets the most attention from adventurers and scholars, its slime trail is even more important to its defense and daily life. Like many other gastropods, the flail snail\u2019s slime comes in two types: thin and slippery or thick and sticky. Both are effective at stopping those seeking to invade the snails\u2019 territory, and allow the snails enough suction to climb walls and ceilings without faltering. Mixing the two even allows the snails to create a sticky rope capable of suspending them in the air, lowering themselves or climbing back up with astonishing ease.<\/br>Flail snails are born from clutches of up to 30 eggs stuck to cavern walls or buried beneath interesting objects (such as altars or lost treasure hordes). Fully hermaphroditic, flail snails begin their courtship ritual by extruding long, chitinous spears that they stab into each other\u2019s flesh, injecting hormones signaling their intent. They then climb as a pair to the highest point available and begin copulating, lowering their entwined bodies on a massive rope of slime and hanging there for hours or days until mating is finished, at which point they may be forced to gnaw off their own reproductive organs in order to separate. Both individuals then lay egg clutches, and the hatchlings\u2014which start out already shelled, the size of a human\u2019s hand\u2014are raised by the community, with no concept of lineage or heredity. Any flail snail sensing a hatchling in danger instantly rushes to its defense, regardless of personal peril. Matings happen sporadically and may be tied to available food sources, though the fact that flail snails appear to be able to live for hundreds or thousands of years makes reproduction a relatively rare occurrence. Under duress, flail snails have even been observed to retract into their shells and go into long periods of hibernation, making it possible that some of the snails currently active are far older than anyone realizes.<\/br>Of course, no discussion of the flail snail\u2019s ecology would be complete without mention of its shell. A magnificent spiral construction several inches thick, the flail snail\u2019s shell grows slowly over time, generated by an organ on the snail\u2019s back known as its mantle, which in turn is fed by metals and minerals scraped in tiny amounts from the stone and ingested as part of the snail\u2019s diet. The wide array of substances used to produce the shell appears to be at least partially responsible for the whorls of color and strange patterns that cover it, though the fact that these often glow after being targeted by magic suggests other factors as well.<\/br>Exactly how the shell manages to reflect magic has long baffled scholars, who have put forth numerous theories. Some suggest that it\u2019s due to the ingestion and combination of various magically reactive metals used in the shell\u2019s construction. Others posit that the shell is a focus for the snail\u2019s own magical energies, and that by the whim of gods or evolution the snail has been restricted to using its powers in a retributive manner, an example of perfect natural balance. Still others maintain that the snail\u2019s shell resonates with magic like a bell, acting as a sort of magical tuning fork whose vibration scatters the waves of energy. Perhaps the most compelling argument is that it\u2019s not the shell\u2019s composition that is key, but rather its shape. This theory holds that the flail snail shell has evolved in a perfect golden spiral, a shape long significant to arcanists and engineers, and that this shape manages to draw magic down into its center and then expel it again in a new direction, like a whirlpool or tornado.<\/br>Characters with ranks in <\/br>With their slow, ponderous movement, flail snails are often written off as dumb beasts by faster-moving races, afforded the same cautious respect as a bull in a pasture but otherwise ignored. This casual disregard is a mistake, however, for behind the flail snail\u2019s slug-like exterior lies an alien intelligence and thousands of years of racial history. Flail snail intelligence is not humanoid intelligence.<\/br>Most civilized humanoids tend to value speed and inference in their decision-making, traits born of an evolution as soft, delicate things in a world of powerful predators. As a creature of ultimate defense and slow movement, the flail snail has none of the same needs. Instead, its own unique brand of consciousness is correspondingly slow and placid, prone to the absorption of vast amounts of information rather than any need to process or leap to conclusions.<\/br>A typical human who managed to communicate with a flail snail might well find the conversation dull, with the snail viewing every thought and detail as separate and unrelated from the others. Yet those monks or other scholars used to such things might recognize in the snail\u2019s koan-like observations a certain Zen poetry hinting at deeper revelations\u2014and indeed, if enlightenment is judged by perfect calm and inherent peace of mind, then the meditative flail snail may yet have the advantage over humanity. Certainly their lives are more pastoral, free from war and the other \u201cadvances\u201d of civilization.<\/br>Though they have no spoken language, flail snails communicate using two different means, both completely silent. The first, an elaborate sign language of waving tentacles, is primarily used for communicating immediate needs, warnings, and other messages that are quickly picked up and passed through the rout. The second and more in-depth form of communication is a complex chemical writing system encoded within the snail\u2019s slime.<\/br>Every flail snail has its own unique chemical signature that makes its slime trail immediately recognizable to other snails. Within its trail, each snail records a running dialogue of its thoughts, observations, and memories in a complex interaction of scents that can linger on the stone long after the slime has dried to dust. Other snails can read this dense stream of information and edit it with their own trails, creating a vast, interwoven cultural narrative that at once contains the snails\u2019 greatest art and the sum of their collective history. Together, the slime trails of two dozen snails weave epic tales worthy of any philosopher-poet.<\/br>Flail snails do not build structures or cities\u2014perhaps because of their lack of fine manipulators, or merely because they\u2019ve transcended such impulses\u2014and instead roam the Darklands singly or in vast troupes, eating their fill, sleeping a few hours a day, and recording their endless songs in the glistening slicks of their passing.<\/br>Flail snails are perfect monsters to shake up subterranean adventures, especially for parties heavy on spellcasters. With their magic-warping shells, the snails add an element of randomness that can be fun and surprising for both GM and players, and force parties into new strategies. Because of their slow speed and ability to make vast swaths of ground almost impassable, flail snails make better guardians than active predators. Perhaps someone has hidden a powerful magic item or spellbook in the center of flail snail territory, knowing that those most likely to hunt for it\u2014spellcasters\u2014will have the hardest time breaking through the flail snails\u2019 lines. And even those parties without a strong magical component are likely to balk at adhesive mucus and 2,000-pound snails dropping toward them from a great height on ropes of slime.<\/br>Flail snails are intelligent, and hence cannot be used as animal companions, but they can make great allies for other subterranean creatures. Mites, with their love of vermin, might relish riding slowly into combat on the armored back of a flail snail, and kobolds used to riding slurks might appreciate the snails\u2019 ability to travel across floors and ceilings with equal ease, helping to set up traps and ambushes. Nor is the use of flail snails restricted to evil races\u2014having little concept of good or evil themselves, the snails are equally likely to ally with svirfneblin or other deep-dwelling races. If a PC has the patience for it, a snail might even make a fun and unusual PC mount, though it should be noted that the snail\u2019s shell does little to protect its rider, and anyone hoping to cling to the snail while upside down on the ceiling had better fashion some sort of harness, or else secure herself with snail slime.<\/br>Flail snails see little need for treasure, or even personal possessions, as their homes, weapons, and armor are all directly attached to their bodies. At most, a flail snail\u2019s territory might contain items dropped by slain trespassers, and more artistic individuals occasionally affix colored gems to their shells with their sticky slime (though the majority consider this a desecration of the shell\u2019s natural beauty). More than any physical object, flail snails value knowledge, history, and poetry, all gained and shared through their ascetic meanderings, and creatures capable of deciphering either of their means of communication might learn a great deal from the slow philosophers.<\/br>Yet when people speak of treasure and the flail snail, they inevitably speak of the shell. The armored spirals are a fundamental part of the snail\u2019s exoskeleton, removable only after death, and many adventurers seek them out to harvest their magic-warping wonders\u2014a practice which gives some snails a justifiably low opinion of humanoids. Removing a shell from a deceased snail is messy work, after which the looter must still find a way to carry several hundred pounds of shell out of the snail\u2019s subterranean home. As the center of the shell seems to be the focus of the magic, it\u2019s possible for a character with heavy tools or weapons to break the shell down to only the 50 pounds necessary for crafting armor and other magical pursuits, but doing so carries a 50% chance of destroying the shell\u2019s powers completely. A functional flail snail shell can sell to a master smith or item crafter for up to 800 gp, though the flail snail\u2019s intelligence makes hunting its kind a morally dubious act.<\/br>Despite its outward similarities to creatures like the giant slug or giant leech, the flail snail represents a divergent branch of evolution; neither of those distant relatives possesses the intelligence or magic-warping abilities that make the flail snail so unique. Already exceptionally rare, the flail snail\u2019s only known variants are almost identical versions that roam the surface world individually or in pairs, or those water-breathing aquatic versions that live deep under the sea or along rocky, turbulent coastlines."},"Fungoid":{"name":"Fungoid","spell":[],"description":"Fungoids are man-sized humanoid creatures formed of mushroom flesh and leaves.

These new verdurous oozes grow to full size within 6 months.<\/br>Verdurous oozes primarily live in temperate forests and plains among high grasses or cultivated crops, though they might also be found in warm plains and jungle environments. As mindless creatures, they pay little attention to others of their kind, save when drawn to reproduce.

Yet, what few beside the wariest hunters and most knowledgeable denizens of the forests realize is that hail lilies are more than mere flowers\u2014their fully grown varieties possess not only a deadly way of spreading their frozen seeds but also an even more dangerous trait: thought. Known among their own kind as calathgars, these ice-tinged plants move slowly and possess little in the way of society, yet they perceive their surroundings, know when their frigid gardens are threatened, feel pain, and\u2014most tenaciously\u2014seek a chilling revenge when their young are despoiled. The blooms of a fully grown calathgar measures 3 feet in diameter, though some have reported flowers up to 5, 8, and even 10 feet wide. Able to crawl on three tendrillike roots, one of these plants might stand as high as 4 feet off the ground, and when heavy with seeds might weigh as much as 50 pounds.<\/br>Calathgars are immediately identifiable, even from a distance, by their sky-blue petals, a color repeated by few other forms of plant life in such size or brilliance. Yet typically, these blooms only unfurl during the brightest hours of the day or when the plants feel threatened. At all other times, calathgars keep their flowers closed, defending the sensitive structures within and presenting large, blue-gray sepals to the outside world. Calathgar young look little different from tall blue flowers\u2014hence many horticulturists identify them merely as hail lilies. It takes nearly a year for a juvenile calathgar to display any kind of concerted movement, aside from the opening and closing of their petals and a few markedly un-plant-like twitches. Their sense of scent and ability to communicate function as soon as their buds first grow\u2014typically within 2 weeks of sprouting from the cold earth. Two rings of sensory organs help calathgars remain aware of their surroundings: a cluster of lobes at the base of the flower and another situated around the stamen within. Both are capable of not just deciphering light in an approximation of visual sight, but also receiving information via a highly developed kind of scent. This sense of smell is much more developed in the plants than their ability to see\u2014though at close ranges their sight can prove just as accurate as most humanoids. To this end, most communication between the plants is scent-based, utterly silent, and often imperceptible to non-plant creatures. At times when the plants feel threatened, however, they exude a smell like vinegar or, if angry, a coppery odor.<\/br>For all their developments as a species, calathgars possess a strange connection, even symbiosis, with a far less complex type of growth: brown mold. Notorious for its ability to drain the warmth from an area and freeze the unwary, brown mold not only benefits calathgars\u2014allowing them to grow comfortably in areas they might otherwise find inhospitably warm\u2014but it also pervades the roots and internal structures of the plants. Some suggest that calathgars might be some advanced form of brown mold, yet the idea is typically dismissed, as such mutually beneficial relationships are well documented in the world of mundane flora. As a calathgar grows to maturity, brown mold thrives within its flower and internal structures, aiding in keeping the growth cool and providing it with frigid defensive abilities and a way to spread its seeds\u2014freezing and clinging to creatures that come near before dropping off later. The flowers provide the mold ample places to grow, and defense from creatures that might threaten it. The adult plants also prove so riddled with nutrients upon which the fungus flourishes that should a calathgar violently die amid brown mold, the fungal patch instantly explodes with growth\u2014typically to the detriment of whatever ended the calathgar\u2019s life.<\/br>Calathgars have little in the way of society, other than grouping together for mutual defense. Despite their intellects, the plants\u2019 psyches prove distinctive and alien in comparison to those of animals and sentient creatures. They have little interest in emotions, culture, or ambition, yet they possess nearly flawless memories and an understanding of experiences which they can share with other calathgars by scent as easily as (and far more effectively than) humanoids can pass on information by speech. Yet where calathgars do seem most like humanoids is in their capacity to care for their young and seek reprisal should any harm befall them. Should an immature calathgar be trampled, plucked, or otherwise ruined, adults do all they can to pursue and deal vengeance upon those who murdered their young, planting a new generation in the killer\u2019s frozen flesh. While calathgars can be reasoned with and most prove generally accepting of honest apologies from those capable of communicating with them, like most enraged parents, an incensed calathgar is rarely in a mood to speak."},"Shining":{"name":"Shining","spell":["shield","shield","shield","transmute rock to mud","Transmute mud to rock","stone to flesh","statue"],"description":"SPECIAL ABILITIES<\/br>A shining sentinel is immune to any spell or <\/br>Whenever a <\/br>Whenever a character strikes a <\/br>A shining sentinel can stand perfectly still, emulating a "},"Caterwaul":{"name":"Caterwaul","spell":[],"description":"Caterwauls are semi-intelligent bipedal felines that possess great speed.

Though chemosits are documented primarily in the tales of indigenous peoples and dozens of written accounts by British colonists and explorers during the early half of the 20th century, modern cryptozoologists continue to pursue the chemosit, with many investigators suggesting it fits the physical description of a chalicothere\u2014a large, knuckle-walking herbivore that lived during the Early Pleistocene era.<\/br> Pathfinder Adventure Path #38: Racing to Ruin. \u00a9 2010, Paizo Publishing, LLC; Author: Tim Hitchcock. \n "},"Chrystone":{"name":"Chrystone","spell":["stone shape","stone tell","color spray","color spray","stone shape","color spray","transmute rock to mud","slow","transmute mud to rock","stone to flesh","color spray","limited wish","polymorph any object","shatter","stone shape","stone tell"],"description":""},"Clamor":{"name":"Clamor","spell":["invisibility purge","restoration","wish","miracle","silence","Ghost sound","major image","minor image","message","ventriloquism","whispering wind","confusion","Sculpt sound","sculpt sound","dominate monster","Shout","sound burst","charm monster"],"description":"Clamors have a playful kind of intelligence, and they appear to desire communication.

Displaying such mettle is a sure way to earn considerable respect from any ordinary sailor\u2014persuading a wyrd to abate its storm could inspire outright awe.<\/br>Comozant wyrds rarely speak even to those fluent in Auran, preferring to communicate in a more primal way, using their illuminating flames. Those who have \u201cconversed\u201d with a wyrd in this way describe an alien mode of communication that is as much raw emotion and image as it is concept and word, and a mysterious mixture of knowledge and ignorance. For instance, when first encountered, a wyrd apparently does not understand how different from itself mortals are, or how dangerous storms are to mortal creatures. Overlying everything is an unsettlingly alien but somehow childlike inquisitiveness, mixed with rage or fear if the wyrd feels threatened.<\/br>The form this interest takes can vary widely. One report describes spending half an hour in communion with a wyrd, exchanging detailed mental images of <\/br>Such vanishing is a reasonably common occurrence in non-hostile encounters with comozant wyrds. Several accounts agree that once wyrds understand the peril in which storms place mortals, they use their command of the weather to end the storm, even though this apparently forces them to either leave or vanish altogether. To some, this suggests that comozant wyrds possess at least some respect for life, and that what seems like cruelty may simply be uncomprehending curiosity, even playfulness.<\/br>Naturally, those who have suffered at a wyrd\u2019s whim are unsympathetic to this view.<\/br>One of the few things almost all accounts agree on is that the touch of a comozant wyrd\u2019s illuminating flames seems to confer sudden insight. Judging by images glimpsed in wyrds\u2019 minds, they appear to know, but not always understand, things that they glimpse in the thoughts, pasts, and entanglements of those with whom they converse. On one occasion, this has led to a traveler learning that one of her companions was in the pay of a hated rival. Other authors recount glimpses of scenes relevant to them that were happening at that precise moment halfway around the world, scenes of which nobody on board could possibly be aware. One way or another, very few of the available reports fail to mention the author glimpsing a secret she could not otherwise learn, an answer\u2014or at least a hint\u2014to a puzzle she had been attempting to solve, or a flash of inspiration that enabled her to complete some great work. These tales lead some desperate souls to seek out storms to sail into, hoping for answers they can find nowhere else.<\/br>Comozant wyrds themselves do not seem to have a discernible agenda from moment to moment, or indeed to place very much weight on past experience. They will attack\u2014or, conversely, stop fighting and \u201cparley\u201d\u2014without hesitation, based purely on whether they feel their immediate situation warrants it. This is not to say that they forget past behavior, but they seem to bear few grudges.

Bound to service by Pazuzu, these demons ride the winds across the Abyssal skies, lurk within dark and turbulent clouds, and act as his scouts and spies. Halas have a single, blood-red eye, an enormous mouth lined with razor-sharp teeth, and lengthy horns growing from their heads. A typical hala stands 7 feet tall, weighs 200 pounds, and possesses large wings that span 20 feet across.<\/br>Hala demons form from covetous souls, those who desired the possessions of others so much so that they indulged in such acts as murder, theft, or blackmail. The more persons harmed by these desires, the more likely the soul is to become a hala in the Abyss. Halas are masters of the winds, harnessing the power of storms, redirecting and amplifying that energy to cause the most damage and chaos possible. They relish the destructive forces of their storms, and can manipulate a storm\u2019s energy to rain down hailstones to pelt the area. Their command of the winds also aids them in flight. They are never impeded by storm winds, but instead ride them, often achieving top speeds by accelerating the wind currents around them.<\/br>Due to the nature of their origin, halas are highly possessive. A hala will often refer to the storm clouds they marshal as \u201cmy storm.\u201d A hala is predisposed to grab any item it finds particularly desirable, and will actively pillage regions that its storm passes over. The desire to take from others remains so prevalent in the hala\u2019s nature that it often carries large sacks in which to place all the items it takes during its f lights. Bags of holding or handy haversacks are highly prized possessions to a hala, as it allows it to pillage even more items. Halas are voracious, with large mouths that open nearly ear-to-ear. Edible items they find in their pillaging are often consumed immediately. This includes a particular appetite for children and other Small humanoids.<\/br>Halas can be seen throughout the Abyss, roaming the skies in servitude to Pazuzu as his dedicated scout force. Their heaviest concentration, however, exists in High M\u2019Vania, as all hala demons are required to return to Pazuzu\u2019s realm once a century to report all that they have observed. Despite the duty to return to High M\u2019Vania, halas are solitary demons, distrusting all others, especially other hala demons, fearing that they will attempt to take their pillaged possessions. Therefore, most halas live in isolated, remote areas where they maintain their hoards of ill-gotten gains.<\/br>Pazuzu values his hala minions not only for the intelligence they gather on the activities of his enemies in the Abyss, but also for the chaos and destruction they bring on the winds. He is especially fond of sending halas to the Material Plane to ravage the countryside with storms and hail. As in the Abyss, halas on the Material Plane prefer to reside in remote areas. The lair of a hala is often located in a hidden cave in an isolated mountain range, or in the hollow of a giant, ancient tree deep in a forest or swamp.<\/br>While hala demons have a general dislike for or distrust of nearly all creatures, they have an especially strong fear and hatred of two creatures: eagles and dragons. Eagles have an innate response to attack and drive a hala from the skies, possibly due to the threat the hala represents to the eagle\u2019s territory and offspring. Dragons\u2014of any breed\u2014largely view the storm demons as a danger to their own hoards of treasure, for if a hala discovers the dragon\u2019s lair, it will stop at nothing to possess all that lies within it."},"Azizou":{"name":"Azizou","spell":["cause fear","desecrate","detect good","detect thoughts","invisibility","scare","stinking cloud"],"description":"The azizou is slightly larger than the barizou and is quite strong (for its size).

This instinct may be tied to the fact that they can stay relatively dormant for decades or even centuries, but eventually they need the life energy of warm-blooded creatures to fuel their strange locomotion. Since they dwell in unforgiving and underpopulated areas, it is easier for them to conserve energy and wait for prey rather than to try to track down warm-blooded creatures.<\/br>After feeding, or when fully fed, these creatures tend to ignore other creatures unless attacked.

The male brings gifts of raw meats and rare fruits to his object of desire, and the gift of horsemeat is seen as an outstanding display of skill and admiration. A griffon suitor who slays a particularly large or powerful steed and presents it to his potential mate frequently gains her favor more quickly, and such a show of mettle is often used to settle disputes between rival suitors.<\/br>When a female griffon accepts a male\u2019s courtship, she engages in an elaborate mating ritual with her suitor, leading the dance as the two perform various cartwheels, swoops, and somersaulting descents, at some point locking talons and plunging toward the earth at high speeds, only to release each other just before they would hit the ground. Should the male fail this final test and fumble one of the complex maneuvers involved in the dance, his chances of mating with the female are effectively nullified, and the female rejects the suitor. However, should the dance succeed, the griffons are thereafter considered united. Griffons mate for life, and should one of a mated pair die at any point, the survivor lives out the remainder of its days alone. Mated griffons who are separated for extended periods of time-either by natural happenstance or forced capture-ardently look for one another, often forgoing food and safety for days in order to find their missing mates.<\/br>Female griffons tend to be larger and heavier than males; the additional weight aids brooding individuals in keeping their eggs warm, a task that can be difficult during winter months in the hilly regions griffons inhabit. A pair of griffons typically produces one to four eggs per year. During the incubation period, the female griffon fervently watches over the nest and the male hunts for food, the latter giving much of his own share of the prey to his mate so she can keep warm while roosting. When an egg hatches, a young griffon the size of a small <\/br>Griffons\u2019 love of horsemeat is a well-known trait of the mythical creatures, and one that causes much distress to ranchers who find their herds straying too close to griffon hunting grounds. Hunting horses often leads griffons into fatal trouble with particularly protective herders who have the means to fend off such huge creatures, but horsemeat can also be used to bribe and train griffons. Good-natured breeders and ill-intentioned thieves alike find reason to tempt griffons with such meat, as the beasts are voracious in their appetites, and can consume as much as half their weight in a single day. That <\/br>Griffons are highly territorial, and once a male and female have established a nest and family, they passionately drive any other creatures away from their territory. In purely territorial disputes between two groups of griffons, most acts of aggression rarely move past threat displays, as griffons share an innate understanding that land is only worth so much, and rarely is it worth the price of blood. However, should a griffon continue to harass a rival or turn its threats toward a nest, youths, or a brooding female, confrontations quickly become deadly.<\/br>Since griffons make their homes in hilly regions with moderate climates, they come into contact with <\/br>Griffons prefer to make their homes in isolated mountainous areas with plenty of cliffs, bluffs, and crags to confuse intruders and protect their homes. Ideally, griffons situate their nests on tall peaks so <\/br>An unmated griffon is much less aggressive toward <\/br>Griffons are sometimes incorporated into campaigns as potential allies to the PCs, and can aid them as mounts (either temporarily or permanently, depending on the particular griffon\u2019s agenda) or fight alongside them in combat. Of course, as all griffons possess unique motivations, they are equally suitable enemies for PCs to face off against, either as the beasts they are or as mounts for powerful NPCs. The threat of a villain\u2019s mount is heightened exponentially when the creature in question is as intelligent and loyal as a griffon. While an ordinary mount would flee upon its rider\u2019s death, a creature as stalwartly dedicated to its rider as a griffon is only made more dangerous when its partner is slain, as it will immediately seek bloody vengeance for its loss. Griffons are also commonly used by wealthy individuals as guardians for their treasure hordes, which can make for interesting encounters with griffons alongside other vault guards. Since much of the challenge in fighting a griffon relies on the fact that the creature can fly, placing one as an enemy in different terrains can dramatically alter the difficulty of the combat. While a griffon encountered in a dungeon might be easier to corner or sneak past, griffons in their natural environments can pose a serious threat-especially if encountered as a group-as they drive PCs onto precarious terrain alongside steep precipices.<\/br>PCs might possess any number of reasons to visit a griffon\u2019s nest, which almost always results in an encounter with such a creature. As mated griffons are highly aggressive toward trespassers who get too near their nests, many innocents have met with untimely ends at the talons of these beasts, and local townsfolk or farmers may recruit the PCs to solve the problem once and for all. Alternatively, a messenger or courier carrying a valuable item or military orders might be slain and dragged back to a griffon\u2019s nest for food. griffon eggs are also highly sought after, and PCs with more flexible ethics may find themselves in the business of snatching such items. On the flip side, PCs who apprehend an egg thief would gain a grateful avian ally should they return the egg to its proper nest.<\/br>Armor, weapons, and magical items can often be found in griffon nests among scattered bones and other <\/br>Of course, a griffon\u2019s most valuable treasures are its eggs. Unborn griffons are highly sought-after commodities, as many see the benefit of having a flying griffon as a mount. griffon youths are in even greater demand, and though difficult to transport, can fetch prices twice as high. Undamaged eggs sell for up to 3,500 gp apiece, though it is imperative that the egg dealer keeps the eggs warm for the entire incubation period (about 5 weeks). The largest markets for griffon eggs are usually among cultures in lands where griffons\u2019 flight capabilities would be particularly beneficial, such as in mountainous regions, sandy deserts, or dry plains. The benefit of having one\u2019s own griffon raised from an egg is often offset by the difficulty of reaching an egg in the first place, as well as fending off the parents long enough to escape. griffon parents pursue thieves with fervent ferocity, and only give up on a chase after several days of searching for the bandits, viciously attacking any creatures that resemble them in the slightest. It should also be noted that, as valuable as griffon mounts are, their intelligence makes buying or selling eggs the equivalent of participating in child slavery in many deities\u2019 eyes.<\/br>The rulers of small kingdoms and other wealthy individuals sometimes seek to obtain griffons to protect their hordes of treasure, so renowned are the creatures for their steadfast protection of their eggs. Because of this, griffons in more civilized areas are often used as guards.<\/br>The most common griffon possesses the hindquarters of a lion and the head, forelegs, and wings of an eagle. Variants can be made by combining other felines and avian creatures, and an individual\u2019s relative strength often coincides with the power and size of its disparate parts. The sand-colored griffons of the deserts tend to resemble mountain lions mixed with chicken hawks, and those who dwell in rainforests have qualities similar to panthers and colorful macaws. Such qualities are largely based on a griffon\u2019s heredity, and while such mishmashes as raven-headed white tigers have been known to exist, these rare cross-breeds are often shunned by both parents and left to fend for themselves, ensuring that relatively few of such anomalies exist throughout the world.<\/br>While most griffons possess wings, there exists a lesser-known variety of the creature that lacks the power of flight, known as the alce. Alce griffons often dwell in the same regions as their winged kin, but choose to form families of their own kind instead of intermingling.<\/br>A griffon egg that is brooded by its father instead of its mother results in an alce griffon. An alce griffon is similar to a normal griffon save that it has no wings and therefore must hone its speed on land in order to survive. Alce griffons are looked down upon by most other griffons, including those in their own nests, and so resent many of their own kind. An alce griffon loses its fly speed and gains a land speed of 40 feet. Its talons deal an amount of damage equal to 1d8 plus 1-1\/2 times the alce griffon\u2019s <\/br>The griffon (also spelled griffin or gryphon) is a mythological creature that has roots in Greek and Middle Eastern mythologies, though it also played a prominent role in European heraldry throughout the Middle Ages. The griffon was considered the king of all creatures because of its combination of the king of beasts-the lion-and the king of birds, the eagle. Many cultures regarded griffons as powerful guardians of treasure and other priceless possessions. Ancient Persians thought of the noble beasts as protectors from evil, witchcraft, and secret slander, while yet others thought of griffons as symbols of divine power.<\/br>Regardless of these cultures\u2019 differing interpretations of the griffon myth, nearly all saw the creatures as signifiers of strength, wisdom, and power, and thus griffons were commonly featured on coats of arms and in heraldry even up until the Renaissance. Though the griffon is a well-known mythological creature, few ancient stories mention heroes encountering any specific griffons, a fact that in and of itself aptly captures the elusive nature of such legendary beings."},"Flue":{"name":"Flue","spell":["alter self"],"description":"Nocturnal and vicious, flue hags terrorize communities across the lands.

They meander through glens\u2014suddenly submerged by their eerie control over water\u2014and recently drowned vales, poking curiously at the remains. Grodairs are intelligent, but extremely absentminded and careless. They have memories little better than actual fish, and for the most part have difficulty remembering things they were told 5 minutes ago\u2014though some facts seem to crystallize within their memories, allowing them to recall events of the distant past with perfect clarity.<\/br>Grodairs are picky eaters, nibbling on the choicest of flotsam. A grodair that raises waters to drown a faerie queen\u2019s castle might then swim in and nibble on a few pieces of cake and frosted grapes; one that has just drowned an orchard might grab a few apples before moving on. They have a similar approach to treasure. Having no need for magical items or artifacts and lacking any conception of their actual purpose, an absentminded grodair often consumes any shiny baubles it comes across, mistaking the loot for brightly colored food.<\/br>The magical organ holding whole lakes worth of water within a grodair has befuddled many sages. It appears to be an extradimensional space accessed through the grodair\u2019s mouth. The grodair can either belch forth highly pressurized blasts of water or gradually drool out enough water to swamp its surroundings. The sac often contains more than water, as the aqueous creature\u2019s vacuum sucks up dirt, leaves, algae, and even small fish\u2014 fueling curiosity as to the waters\u2019 origins.<\/br>Grodairs are solitary creatures, meeting others of their kind only rarely. When their paths\u2014or rather, their streams\u2014cross, a pair of grodairs may mate and produce a dozen or so small fry. After the eggs hatch, they are the responsibility of the male grodair to raise and teach for 3 years (assuming, of course, he remembers his responsibility). Once the small grodairs reach the age of 3, they are fired out of their sire\u2019s tentacles on a high pressure jet of water in the direction of the nearest large lake or ocean.<\/br>Grodairs are driven to explore, but they cannot say why\u2014if there ever was a reason for their constant watery peregrinations, they forgot it long ago. One bizarre theory is that grodairs were an early attempt by the gods to fix the broken flow of water across the ever-changing landscape. If this theory is true, then there should be other creatures out there that have similar powers to move mountains or reshape the world. Another tale claims that grodairs are the servants of a buried god who was imprisoned under the ocean when the other deities abandoned the First World, and that they search for his drowned tomb to free him, while a third theory insists that the extradimensional space in the sac requires constant renewal, and that most of a grodair\u2019s brain is taken up with casting and recasting the same spell over and over. Sensible sages, though, just point to the grodairs as another example of the ill-considered and haphazard nature of reality in the land of the fey.<\/br>The forgetful grodairs rarely mean to cause deliberate harm, but are often so distracted they forget that other creatures cannot breathe underwater. A grodair might drown a village, then swim into the ruins wondering why everyone is taking a nap. When their errors are pointed out to them, grodairs become immensely apologetic, offering to do whatever they can to make amends. \u201cWould you like a nice ornamental pond,\u201d they ask, \u201cor perhaps a waterwheel?\u201d In any event, the creatures soon lose interest and swim off in search of something more interesting that they cannot name. In the past, some vengeful souls have tried hunting grodairs, but when cornered they are surprisingly doughty foes, using blasts of high-pressure water to send enemies flying and soaking the ground around them to make it harder for enemies to attack them in melee. If a foe is knocked <\/br>Grodairs also have a surprisingly powerful tail swipe and viciously sharp teeth.

Alternatively, many predators simply attack from above.<\/br>Most grodairs explode in a blast of murky water and over-sized fish guts when slain. Some, however, do not. Only grodairs that meet death with their fragile internal extraplanar space intact don\u2019t erupt in this fashion.

A vulpinal looks like a humanoid fox, often with brilliantly colored fur (usually red or red-brown, though silver is not uncommon) and a tail as long as its height. As the bards and sages of the agathions, they dress in functional clothing, typically embellishing a single article to show their creativity and personality. Most appear to be adults, though others look more like fox kits (with shorter stature and larger eyes) while some look much older (leaner, with gray fur on the muzzle, chest, and tail). Their hands are humanoid in shape, with tiny clawed fingers. <\/br>A typical vulpinal prefers a life of solitary travel, though they have been known to pair up or travel in groups if they find like-minded individuals who have much to teach and share. They are particularly fond of lillends, and these winged azatas can easily carry the child-sized vulpinals, giving vulpinals many opportunities to share stories. Indeed, for a vulpinal, there are few greater pleasures than sharing their knowledge\u2014acting as sages of the planes, teaching songs and dances from exotic places, and composing poems about beautiful places in the natural world. Though they are gentle by nature, they fight to defend beauty, especially if their magic can bolster the more martial celestial races. <\/br>A vulpinal stands about 3 feet in height and weighs 50 pounds. <\/br>Among the smallest of Nirvana\u2019s agathion celestials, vulpinals tend to be the most reclusive of their kind, and also the most far-ranging across the plane. While their avoral and leonal kindred might restrict themselves to mountaintop aeries and monasteries, as well as to the guardianship of the plane\u2019s gates, portals, and other important locations, vulpinals can be found anywhere. <\/br>Like other agathions, vulpinals look like humanoid animals, specifically bipedal anthropomorphic foxes that stand about 3 feet tall. Individuals may vary in coloration, length of ear or muzzle, and so on. True to their roles as wandering bards, sages, and unassuming sorcerers, they typically dress in loose clothing, usually of a simple and functional appearance. Despite this, their often brilliantly colored fur (usually red or red-brown, though silver is also common) more than makes up for any sense of drabness, especially with tails as long as the vulpinals are tall. In addition, they tend to have a f lair for the dramatic, and individual vulpinals often pick a single article of clothing and grant it some signature artistry as an expression of their creativity and personality. <\/br>True children of Nirvana, vulpinals possess a unique status among the mortal souls that enter their native plane. As with all the agathions, vulpinals began their existences as mortals. Vulpinals usually appear to be adults, but some look younger (with larger eyes, shorter stature, and kit-like proportions) or older (with an overall leaner look and gray fur about the muzzle and tail). Vulpinals say they appear as the age they felt most defined them during life, or the age at which they were most happy during their mortal existence, though they avoid the question of just how much of their mortal lives they still remember. <\/br>While there are male and female vulpinals, and they are affectionate among their own kind and with other good creatures, vulpinals cannot reproduce; they only originate directly from mortal souls arriving in Nirvana. This also means that every vulpinal is a unique individual, and they do not have strong family ties to other vulpinals (though they of course form friendships with other vulpinals and other good creatures). <\/br>Vulpinals tend to be solitary creatures, perpetually wandering across Nirvana, experiencing whatever they find, sharing, teaching, and learning from whomever they come across before moving on to continue their temporal and spiritual journey. Despite this wandering life, likeminded vulpinals inevitably find that their journeys cross paths time and time again, especially for those who form more intimate or romantic associations (including such pairings outside of their kind). Such meetings allow them to share their journeys and new insights, and once they part ways once again, they do so knowing that their plane will guide them back together. Vulpinals are kindred spirits to lillend azatas; both are wanderers and devotees of art and music. Because vulpinals are small and light, it is an easy matter for a lillend to carry one while f lying, and they sometimes take soaring journeys together, appreciating the scenery, and composing poems or songs about the beauty of the natural world. <\/br>Rather than engaging in a self-absorbed journey of personal enlightenment, vulpinals freely share their collected knowledge as sages, perform songs, dances, and stories as bards, and spread a thousand miracles as sorcerers. Though they usually travel alone, vulpinals within a given area often congregate together, collaborating in their music or storytelling, debating in their areas of focus, and even sharing spells. Such meetings are not exclusive to their own kind, and as they travel, their ears and whiskers remain keen to the needs of the plane as a whole, and they feel drawn to such places in times of need. When a flood of proteans emerges from the Maelstrom borderlands or an Abyssal chasm erupts near Nirvana\u2019s borders, groups of vulpinals inevitably appear to provide aid to the besieged leonal and angelic defenders, oftentimes with a zeal and ferocity that stands in stark contrast to their small stature and mellow reputation."},"Ahuizotl":{"name":"Ahuizotl","spell":[],"description":"A carnage-hungry denizen of swamps, the ahuizotl is a ferocious-looking predator, even before one takes into consideration its most distinctive feature\u2014a long tail that ends in a clawed but all-too-<\/br>Despite its preference for cruelty, an ahuizotl might come to mutually advantageous arrangements with other pernicious denizens of the swamps. <\/br>Ahuizotls are exceptionally long-lived, and a single individual might live and feed in a particular area for several <\/br>Carnage-hungry denizens of the swamp, at a glance ahuizotls look little different than overlarge otters or a variety of other water-dwelling mammals. Their hindquarters reveal them to be far stranger beasts, though, as each possesses a powerful tail ending in a fifth hand with deadly claws. From the depths of their aquatic homes, ahuizotls look skyward, watchful for any boat or intruder that might trespass into their territories. Upon sighting such prey, their tentacle-like tails burst from the murk, dragging their victims down to meet death amid their powerful jaws and the drowning mire. Yet for all their ferocity, ahuizotls are blasphemously wasteful, for all they desire from their meals are the crunch of dismembered teeth and nails and the cool slime of freshly extracted eyes. What remains they release forth to the waves, to other aquatic predators, and to their victims\u2019 shocked mourners.<\/br>Ahuizotls measure roughly 8 feet long, with a powerful build causing their weights to average around 1,300 pounds.<\/br>An ahuizotl\u2019s most distinctive feature is easily its tail. Measuring double the length of the creature\u2019s body, this prehensile fifth appendage exhibits just as much strength, dexterity, and precision as any of the creature\u2019s other limbs, with the added benefits of both extended range of motion and its own sharply clawed hand. The claw at the tail\u2019s end is leaner and more nimble than an ahuizotl\u2019s other simian hands, with long and bone-hard nails. This gives the creature the nimble adroitness it requires to gather its favorite and most revolting meal\u2014humanoid eyes. In addition to its use as both a weapon and tool, this powerful limb also proves highly useful in locomotion, aiding ahuizotls in moving through the water at surprising speeds.<\/br>Aside from ahuizotls\u2019 fearsome fifth limb, their voices also serve as exceptionally deadly weapons. Through practice and memories of past cruelties, ahuizotls exhibit a shocking capacity to mimic the sounds and voices of other creatures. While they find the sobs of the lost and imperiled the easiest to reproduce and the most useful in coaxing other creatures into aquatic ambushes, most also practice mimicry, granting them mastery over locally used languages and voices to impersonate and allowing them to create more subtle deceptions. To this end, an ahuizotl that manages to take a victim alive and that fears no threat of attack or of its prey\u2019s escape might spend as much as an hour tormenting and mocking its captive. As it does so, it listens intently, usually shooting its victim\u2019s words back in mockery until it feels it has adequately impersonated its victim\u2019s speech. The end usually comes swiftly for those an ahuizotl feels it has nothing more to gain from. This method of trickery proves most dangerous for swamp-dwelling humanoids, as an ahuizotl might swim along below boats or beneath stilt homes and spend hours listening and practicing, eventually mastering enough voices to launch a campaign of deception and murder.<\/br>Ahuizotls prove exceptionally long-lived, with a single individual living and feeding in an area for several human generations. Generally solitary creatures, they have few opportunities to encounter others of their kind or breed, contributing to the creatures\u2019 rarity in most regions. <\/br>Ahuizotls can move about on both land and in the water, yet they far prefer the freedom and safety of murky rivers and pools to crawling upon the earth. Leaving the depths only to when shifting to other waterways, when pursuing prey, or when something else on land captures its interest, an ahuizotl spend most of its life lurking just below the surface, watchful for any prey that ventures close enough to grab with its tail and drag down to a drowning death. While capable of surviving in seawater, few ahuizotls have ever been found along the coast; they seem to possess a kind of race-wide aquatic agoraphobia, shunning oceans and seas for more confined and predictable waterways. Occasionally ahuizotls might be found along the coasts of great freshwater lakes, but even then most keep to shallow bays or bayous.<\/br>Although ahuizotls might range through the waterways of a territory several miles in diameter, most have a favored pool, pond, or bog. Not only does the creature spend much of the day resting in a shelter\u2014either natural or constructed\u2014at the bottom of this body of water, but the area often takes on significance among cultures dwelling in the area as a place of ill omen or the home of a deadly drowning spirit. Aside from the stories that both draw and deter investigators to such sites, over time, the remains of dozens of victims accumulate amid the rock and mud of the pool\u2019s floor. Depending on the age and deadliness of an ahuizotl, its home might become a waterlogged charnel treasure trove, scattered not only with heaps of bones, but also with the wealth and equipment of all who have fallen prey to the beast.<\/br>On rare occasions, ahuizotls might come to mutually advantageous arrangements with other pernicious denizens of the swamps. Will-o\u2019-wisps and ahuizotls often find themselves in such cooperative relationships, with the will-o\u2019-wisp coaxing creatures near the ahuizotl\u2019s lair and then lingering to feed upon the victim\u2019s fear as the ahuizotl drags it into the depths. Some wily humanoids who fall into an ahuizotl\u2019s clutches\u2014typically lizardfolk, goblins, or swamp-dwelling humans\u2014have successfully managed to bargain away the lives of others in exchange for their own. Such might lead to a series of vicarious murders, as the aquatic predator\u2019s proxy coaxes new victims into the swamp for its fearsome partner to dine upon."},"Choral":{"name":"Choral","spell":["detect evil","detect evil","aid","ghost sound","dispel evil","dispel magic","invisibility","plane shift","remove curse","remove disease","remove fear","cure moderate wounds","sculpt sound","sound burst","calm emotions","heroism","shout","greater heroism","holy word"],"description":"Choral angels are vocalists of unparalleled talent, and their singing fill the halls of good deities with soaring hymns and solemn chants.

These disgusting abominations writhe through flooded pits and crevices, feeding upon nearly all they encounter and occasionally breaking forth from the depths into the world of light to glut themselves upon the plump, tender creatures found there. <\/br> Rorkouns measure over 25 feet in length, and beneath the strange secretions that provide them with a false, apparent bulk, the creatures possess a ribbon-thin body only a foot wide. A typical rorkoun weighs a mere 200 pounds. <\/br> Little is known of the anatomy and life processes of rorkouns because of both their rarity and their fundamental dependency on water. As soon as a rorkoun leaves the water\u2014which none ever do willingly, even to pursue the most tempting prey\u2014it begins dehydrating at a deadly rate. Most that are ripped from their native pools wither to long strips of jerky-like flesh in a few short minutes. Thus, much of what is known of the beasts comes from direct observation, a methodology that proves dangerous for most researchers. <\/br> Rorkouns possess lengthy bodies similar to tapeworms, with simple, decentralized bodily systems. Their flat, oblong heads branch into four split mouthparts set on throat-like stalks. At the top of the head, a single, bulging eye scans the creature\u2019s surroundings with uncanny sensitivity. Their heads are the thickest parts of their bodies, which taper gradually to a powerful tail. The strangest quality of these creatures is that their body exudes a rubbery, glue-like substance that swiftly hardens into a flexible, putty-like mass. Rorkouns use these secretions to better protect their bodies, seal off their chosen lairs (to prevent water from seeping out), and capture their prey. <\/br> Several explorers who have encountered rorkouns have spread unnerving stories regarding the beasts, suggesting that rorkouns are not individual creatures but rather the impossibly long appendages of some unknown aberrant body. Their hesitance to leave the water is thus claimed to be because they are incapable of separating themselves from their greater body; the frantic thrashing of rorkoun that are forcibly removed from the water as they struggle to return is compared to the final desperate twitches of an amputated limb. <\/br> Solitary creatures, rorkoun rarely share hunting grounds. Most, upon encountering another of their kind, attempt to leave the vicinity, avoiding any sort of confrontation and often ridding the area of both creatures. This aversion proves baffling, especially considering the extreme rarity of the beasts, though some suggest that the abominations might prove more receptive toward others of their kind when far below the surface. <\/br> Those scholars who study rorkouns claim the strange beasts understand both the Common language and that of goblins, though most believe the creatures also have a silent language used among their own kind\u2014despite the creatures\u2019 tendency to avoid contact with one another. They frequently live near goblin and mite communities. While these species share an ecological niche as scavengers and occasional hunters, the connection is a bit more complex. Rorkouns never hunt goblins or mites as they find the taste of their flesh repulsive. The creatures do, however, find the savory flavor of greater humanoids succulent; they appreciate the zeal with which those races seek to exterminate goblinkind, as it brings prey close to their lairs for them to feast on. Cowardly and secretive, rorkouns lurk in murky pools or bogs near such creatures\u2019 camps, hoping to provoke a fight. Once the battle begins, rorkouns strike, picking off the weakest creatures in the fray before slinking off to digest the meal in the privacy of their dens or some other location where their prey\u2019s allies might find it difficult to follow. A rorkoun\u2019s benefactors rarely understand the reason for this strange kind of cooperation. While mites tend to fear and flee the aberrations\u2014just as they do most creatures\u2014 goblins often concoct more elaborate reasons for why these alien horrors might aid them. Typically, a particularly imaginative goblin convinces his tribe that the rorkoun is in fact a god and that they are its chosen people. All too often this inspires the community to new heights of crazed zealotry and the invention of bizarre forms of sacrifice and adoration. <\/br> Occasionally rorkouns find their way into the dilapidated or abandoned sewer systems of ruined or declining cities where the shattered remains of such networks have collapsed. There rorkouns crawl and swim their way through the slick tunnels and drainpipes, feeding on refuse, vermin, and the occasional sewer dweller or rat catcher. Such unusual beasts rarely prove significant threats, emerging to menace the surface only through what abandoned tunnels and drainage ditches they might happen upon.

The average skrik nettle shoal consists of three dozen or more of the majestic creatures, but these flocks are often split up during the roaring storms so common to the First World. Lone skrik nettles may be encountered in smaller numbers, confused and trying to find their way back to their kin.<\/br>Skrik nettles range in size from a few inches across (for a newly spawned hatchling) to the size of gigantic, scintillating clouds. Most, however, are no more than 8 or 9 feet across.<\/br>Skrik nettles are primarily scavengers, although they will attack suitable prey when hungry. Their method of attack is curious. The sharp beaks of a skrik nettle drip with a magical poison that is injected when the creature bites a foe. The victim of the poison feels slightly nauseous and light-headed at first\u2014and then begins to float off the ground.<\/br>As long as the poison pumps through the veins of the skrik nettle\u2019s victim, the victim keeps floating up into the sky. The victim has no control over this magical levitation\u2014unless she has some other method of controlling her flight, such as wings or magic, or she can grab a convenient tree branch, she will keep ascending until the poison wears off and gravity takes hold once more. The skrik nettles usually float up alongside their prey, keeping it floating by injecting more poison as soon as it starts to drop. Especially dangerous or hardshelled prey might be poisoned, allowed to rise, and then dropped repeatedly from a height until dead.<\/br>The poison\u2019s effects seem to be rooted in magic, rather than venom, and dispelling the ailment has proven to be just as effective as bleeding a victim. Before aiding a victim, however, one must take caution to tie said creature down securely, as there are few deaths more ironic than being cured of a skrik nettle\u2019s poison only to instantly plunge to earth from a great height. Oddly, in addition to traditional remedies, killing a skrik nettle also instantly cancels the effects of its poison.<\/br>Once every year, skrik nettles return to their shoal\u2019s spawning grounds to reproduce. The jellyfish-like creatures form hard, rugged eggs inside their bodies, then float gently down to the spawning ground\u2014usually a jungle clearing or warm swamp\u2014and dig nests with their tentacles. Skrik nettles are hermaphrodites, so each one lays its eggs and then fertilizes those of its neighbor (this cross-breeding strengthens future generations of skrik nettles). The average skrik nettle lays three or four eggs, whose size ranges from that of a clenched fist to that of a giant\u2019s skull.<\/br>These eggs incubate in the warm earth for several days, during which time the skrik nettles patrol above the spawning ground, attacking anyone who might disturb the eggs. When ready to hatch, the eggs explode out of the ground and shoot into the sky, bursting into a swarm of newborn skrik nettles. Unwary travelers who slip past the patrolling skrik nettles can trigger a premature hatching if they walk over the spawning ground; such travelers may be pummeled by flying, rock-hard egg shards, or even carried into the sky by a particularly large hatchling.<\/br>Hatchling skrik nettles are ravenously hungry when born. To provide for the needs of their young, skrik nettle shoals assemble caches of poisoned meat and float them over the spawning ground. A wary explorer can spot a spawning ground from afar if she notices rotting corpses hanging overhead. Skrik nettle eggs can often be sold to the fey. Some train young skrik nettles as songbirds, teaching all six beaks to sing in harmony. Others wrap skrik nettle eggs in cloth filled with golden dust or brightly colored pollen; when an egg prepared in such a manner flies into the sky and explodes upon hatching, the cloth\u2019s contents scatter across the sky like a beautiful firework. Such entertainments are popular at parties\u2014though the ensuing swarm of carnivorous jellyfish swooping down on the guests is considered less enchanting.<\/br>Skrik nettles dwell amid the clouds, descending only to feed and procreate. They use their songs to keep the shoal together, flying toward the chirping music of their kin. Bards are often able to lure skrik nettles down to them with their enchanting melodies, but once within range, the poisonous creatures usually trade this performance for a live meal.<\/br>Skrik nettles are not especially intelligent predators\u2014 thus, they eat the bounty of the land, or, if particularly lucky, snatch a dead or weak creature from the ground. While skittish, they retaliate when attacked, regarding the assault as a chance to feed. Settlements in regions where skrik nettle migrations are common usually keep a few sacrificial animals handy to lure the skrik nettles away during a hunt. The one exception is where the skrik nettle\u2019s spawning grounds are involved\u2014during the time before a hatching, the skrik nettle shoal patrols the area around the spawning grounds and viciously attacks any trespassers. Skrik nettles are also a hazard to flyers. They lurk in low-hanging clouds, letting their tendrils trail down out of the mist. An unwary bird or flying creature can be stung, grabbed, and whisked off to be eaten in a matter of seconds. When scavenging, they fly at a low level above the landscape, letting their tendrils play over the ground as they search for carrion.<\/br>Skrik nettles themselves have few natural predators. They are reputed to taste so light and airy that eating one is like trying to eat a soap bubble, albeit a soap bubble with a half-dozen stinging beaks. Skrik nettles perceive the world by sensing air currents and shifting vibrations through their sensitive tentacles; during storms or strong winds, they secure themselves in the forks of large trees and wait out the harsh weather.<\/br>Some fey hunt the skrik nettle shoals in little flying boats for sport, bringing them down with weighted nets or leaden harpoons. A few fey even try riding skrik nettles, \u201cdocking\u201d them to make them harmless by clamping their beaks shut and then hanging a saddle from the tentacles, but the creatures are too weak to make good steeds. It is also the fashion in some regions for noble faerie-maidens to be accompanied by a small flock of \u201cdocked\u201d skrik nettles, each one bearing a fan, mirror, or basket of fruit in its tentacles.

From a distance, stymphalides might easily be mistaken for cranes, ibises, or other long- necked birds, though in full sunlight their gleaming feathers and the haze of blood lingering from past meals are impossible to mistake.<\/br>Peculiarly, the feathers and beak of a stymphalides are made of steel, similar to the metallic hide of a gorgon.<\/br>The wings of stymphalides are as sharp as knives and often lacerate their prey as the birds swarm and beat their wings against their unfortunate victims\u2019 skin. Similarly, their beaks are supernaturally sharp and can pierce the tough hides of animal prey or the armor of those warriors foolish enough to hunt the creatures. Even if a victim of a stymphalides swarm\u2019s frenzied attacks manages to fend off the vicious creatures, the wounds caused by the birds continue to bleed long after being inflicted, and the victim often perishes from loss of blood before ever reaching help.<\/br>Most stymphalides stand approximately 2-1\/2 feet tall and weigh little more than 40 pounds. Although mean-tempered and territorial, lone stymphalides prove relatively harmless, thus traveling in swarms of several dozen, relying on strength of numbers to bring down large or dangerous prey. Many tales also tell of enormous breeds of these monstrous birds, powerful enough to prey upon wyverns. These giant stymphalides are said to grow up to 13 feet tall and weigh over 250 pounds, with wingspans reaching upward of 25 feet. Such gigantic stymphalides are rarely seen, preferring to lurk upon desolate cliffs or even amid harsh extraplanar realms.<\/br>Unlike vultures and other birds of the deserts and plains, stymphalides do not scavenge carcasses, although they are not above driving away natural scavengers if a large, fresh kill looks particularly inviting. When traveling in flocks, stymphalides prove fearless predators, swooping in and swarming any creature that wanders into their territory. The birds actively hunt their prey, harrying and killing lone individuals or stragglers. The attacks of a stymphalides swarm often prove so vicious that the creatures can take to flight once they have wounded prey, wait for it to bleed to death, and return to pick the corpse clean.<\/br>Stymphalides generally avoid attacking large groups of people, unless the birds have gathered in a particularly sizable flock.<\/br>Stymphalides are not purely carnivorous. A lone stymphalides might resort to eating fruit and other plants if it is separated from its flock or food is scarce, and orchards and fields of crops have been devastated by stymphalides when great swarms of the birds, starving from overpopulation or lack of prey, migrate to new territories. Yet although the birds are omnivorous, they seem to prefer meat. Those plainsfolk or desert-dwellers whose livelihoods depend on livestock have learned to fear the sight of flocks of birds silhouetted against the sky, as herds of cattle and other grazing animals have been ravaged by their swarms.<\/br>Most swarms of stymphalides roost near watering holes, rivers, and coastal cliffs, preying upon unfortunate creatures desperate enough to seek food or water so near to the dangerous birds\u2019 nests. The nests of stymphalides are frequently made from the bones of the creatures\u2019 prey, piled into macabre ziggurats upon which entire flocks of the birds rest. Particularly large flocks of the birds construct enormous nests, and giant stymphalides can create towers visible for miles.<\/br>When not at rest, flocks of the creatures soar high on warm currents of air, relying upon their keen eyesight to spot suitable prey far below. Because of their voracious appetites, flocks of stymphalides must claim a vast swath of territory to maintain their feeding habits. Stymphalides are fiercely territorial, and flocks of the birds frequently fight with one another in swooping aerial battles to determine possession of land.<\/br>Fortunately for the folk of civilized lands, stymphalides rarely encroach upon areas well traveled by humanoids and other creatures clever enough to bring down one of these metal-winged avians. Among the people of the plains, the metallic birds are often regarded as nearly legendary creatures. Stymphalides breed at an astonishing rate, however, and overpopulation and exhaustion of game frequently force extraordinarily large and deadly groups of the creatures to band together in search of new lands and new prey to devour."},"Swan":{"name":"Swan","spell":["dancing lights","confusion","deep slumber","entangle","glitterdust","major image","beast shape I"],"description":"Swan maidens are "},"Tear":{"name":"Tear","spell":["detect thoughts","produce flame","searing light","magic jar","Remove curse"],"description":"First spawned by a primordial godling, these fiery, parasitic "},"Temporal":{"name":"Temporal","spell":["slow","slow","slow","haste","haste","time stop","temporal stasis"],"description":"A six-foot long hairy, gray spider crawls forth.

A chimera\u2019s dragon head may be of any evil dragon type, with the corresponding breath weapon, and its wings usually match the scales on its head. Chimeras speak with three overlapping voices, but rarely do so, typically only when playing toady to a more powerful creature. A chimera is 5 feet tall at the shoulder, nearly 10 feet long, and weighs 700 pounds.<\/br>Chimeras prefer meat but can subsist on vegetable matter if necessary (although being forced to do so generally leaves the beasts more ill-tempered than usual). Their flight means they can pick and choose their prey, and they usually hunt a large area in search of easy food. They are too stupid and belligerent to acquire followers, though sometimes a tribe of kobolds might give them offerings. Conversely, they are just intelligent and stubborn enough that they make poor pets, and only a significantly more powerful creature can keep them submissive. They may form equal partnerships with a respectful humanoid or similar creature, and even consent to be used as a mount. A pride of chimeras is very leonine in its hierarchy, with a dominant male leading the group and most of the hunting done by the females. A solitary chimera may be a young male or a female with cubs nearby.<\/br>The chimera is an evil creature of mysterious origin, resembling a great lion with its head flanked on one side by the head of a chromatic dragon, and on the other by the head of a goat . Upon its shoulders, a chimera possesses a pair of scaly leathery wings, and its tail is similarly scaled, matching the color of its draconic head. The chimera\u2019s legend is possibly even more powerful than the strange beast itself, perhaps because tales about it always grow in the telling. The creature is so strangely stitched together that seemingly any story about it is believable. Rumors, myths, fireside stories, and travelers\u2019 tales fill in gaps about what a chimera might be or what it could do, and none seem impossible or unlikely for a beast of such bizarre qualities. It has so many and such varied features that each one gains its own embellishment, until the creature becomes an epic tapestry of monstrous menace and brutal hatred, ideas which in and of themselves are not entirely divorced from the reality of the chimera, regardless of how inaccurate the specifics may be. Its name has become a byword among doubters, skeptics, and naysayers, who refer to anything that seems impossible, fanciful, or overly embellished as chimerical, for surely nothing in the world could possibly be all the dubious things perpetuators of the chimera myth claim the monster to be. Nonetheless, lingering in the back of even the most cynical individuals\u2019 minds is the knowledge that whatever the chimera is, it must be a truly horrifying beast to garner such extravagant fables.<\/br>Skeptics are correct in thinking that the tales of the chimera do in fact outstrip the reality. A chimera can speak, but it is only barely intelligent, able to do little more than curse, bluster, threaten, or (when tamed by a mightier power) complain. Chimeras are cunning enough to set rudimentary traps and create ambushes, but, while effective, their tactics are crude at best. They can fly, but clumsily and without grace. They are fierce in battle when they have the advantage, but if bloodied are apt to retreat in search of easier prey. They are not so much cowardly as they are indolent, content to scavenge rather than hunt if easy food does not present itself. Chimeras graze and gnaw plants down to the ground, despoiling fertile lands with their great hunger when they choose not to do so with their caustic breath. A chimera is always on the prowl for bigger and better prey, however, and when hungry will attack just about any creature smaller than itself.<\/br>Despite all these coarse qualities, a chimera is highly adaptable, able to survive in the midst of desolation, and in possession of a hateful cunning. Its savage brain is just bright enough to remember an attacker and seek revenge, clever enough not to fall for the same trick twice, and social enough to gather together in prides when overwhelming an enemy is the best way to win a fight.<\/br>Chimeras are born of primordial evil, not the result of accidental creation but rather the mad design of a chthonic mother of monsters who knit together the first chimera within her own womb. She sought to create a hunter, but one that would survive on green grass and dry thorn bush when prey was scarce. It would both fly and run. It would spot enemies from afar and slink stealthily through the grass. It would be smart enough to outwit any animal, and fierce enough to outfight any <\/br>While chimeras habitually hunt from the air, they are not strong or agile flyers, and thus typically avoid high and windy mountains where the air is cold and thin, as well as heavily forested areas filled with obstacles to hinder their movement. However, chimeras thrive in jagged and craggy badlands rife with plunging canyons, soaring natural arches and spires, and broken terrain carpeted with scrub-lands in which they can take cover and lie in ambush. Bursting from its hiding place, a chimera feels no shame in fighting dirty, whipping sand and grit into a blinding storm while blasting prey with its magical breath. Should any survive its initial onslaught, a chimera tries to isolate one victim to carry off for later feasting, taking maximum advantage of the terrain by flying across ravines and over cliffs so enemies cannot follow. Chimeras are also clever enough to create crude traps for their victims, preparing landslides or deadfalls to unleash onto travelers below their aeries, afterward swooping down to pick off survivors as they dig themselves out. Though savage and cruel, chimeras are generally more interested in a good meal than a hard fight, and would rather disable a single opponent and fly off with the spoils than divide their efforts between multiple targets.<\/br>While it has three heads, a chimera has only a single consciousness that links them. Chimeras are no more resistant to mind-affecting effects than other creatures, and their heads speak with a single mind and voice, never arguing with each other. While the damage dealt by a chimera\u2019s <\/br>Chimeras are social creatures, living in leonine prides led by a single dominant female that rules over a pack of male hunters. While chimeras were created to be true hermaphrodites, with mating leaving both partners pregnant, over time their social ordering has led to sexual dimorphism, with the dominant member of each pack assuming a female role and the other pack members acting as males. When the female pack leader dies (perhaps killed by a male challenger), chimeric biology enables a surviving pack member-usually the most powerful male-to change from male to female. The reverse is also true when a deposed female chimera survives its loss of position or when a female chimera alone or in a mated pair joins an existing pride.<\/br>While fearsome of aspect, chimeras are largely lazy, petty, and cruel creatures. Their limited faculties of speech are primarily dedicated to crude threats and boasts about their ferocity, but in truth they prefer to feed their appetites and their egos with the least amount of effort required. While capable of hunting, the dominant chimera in a pride is happier to have others do the hunting for her, taking the choicest spoils for herself. In a similar fashion, a lone chimera or mated pair prefers to frighten others into paying tribute whenever possible, saving the trouble of seeking and catching its own prey. While chimeras consider <\/br>Chimeras may cultivate <\/br>As chimeras are often the crude leaders of lesser creatures, they make excellent capstone monsters for low-level adventures. Their versatility in combat makes encounters featuring them viable for a variety of parties of the right level, as their flight and ability to hover allow them to counter ranged attacks, and their <\/br>Chimeras are often most effective when they are foreshadowed before being encountered. As chimeras\u2019 traits are often exaggerated, it is fitting for villagers plagued by chimera attacks to make hyperbolic remarks about the monster that seem slightly askew or at least unlikely. Tribes or cults may offer a chimera tribute in exchange for its protection or simply to avert its wrath, leaving offerings and making sacrifices on crude altars. While a chimera encounter should not be so built up that the final reveal seems anticlimactic, the beast and its influence on the people around it should feel eerie and mysterious. It thus becomes a legendary monster that is heard of before it is ever seen, living somewhere apart from the creatures that venerate it or try to buy its loyalty. A chimera can be brought in at a strategic moment during a battle, making a dramatic entrance on the scene to aid the PCs\u2019 foes just as the party feels it has won, and the beast\u2019s cruelty and dim wit can be emphasized by having it injure its supposed allies or subjects with friendly fire.<\/br>Chimeras are simple creatures, usually content with a cave or similar location as a lair. They seek out lairs that suit their abilities, without narrow bottlenecks that would restrict their movement and with high enough ceilings to facilitate flight, especially favoring caves atop or in the middle of cliff faces and nests among rocky spires. Where possible, they set up rockfalls or even acquire nets or similar items to drop on creatures climbing to their lairs, using their breath to destroy ropes and other climbing gear as pesky adventurers make their ascent, making the approach toward the chimera as dangerous as the fight itself.<\/br>A chimera may keep a number of cowed servants at its lair to groom it and fawn over it (or for the monster to eat when the mood strikes), but any such unfortunates need to accommodate themselves to the chimera\u2019s choice of lair, as it is unlikely to go out of its way to make them comfortable. Such servants often keep ranged weapons or polearms to attack creatures approaching their bestial master\u2019s home, or they may be sent as raiders to capture tender <\/br>At high levels, chimeras do not present much danger to PCs as solitary enemies, but when encountered in groups, they concentrate their <\/br>Chimeras often hoard shiny baubles, though they are not the obsessive collectors that their partly draconic nature might imply. To a chimera, appearance is more important than value, and the more ostentatious a trophy the better. They recognize the value of coins, though any coin is much the same to them as another, and the same is true with gems and jewelry. They are far less interested in appraising the true worth of an object than they are in how it looks, and are only too happy to adorn themselves with various trinkets if the items would make them look more frightening. Even though they cannot use most weapons or <\/br>Chimeras are arrogant and prideful creatures, and so their favorite trophies are ones that memorialize their triumphs in battle. While chimeras\u2019 primary motivation in carrying off dead enemies is to feast on the corpses without being disturbed, their secondary purpose is almost always to collect and organize the belongings of their victims. Chimeras show unusual punctiliousness in arranging the spoils of won battles, and an individual will use these relics to decorate its lair or fashion them to itself in hopes of inspiring fear and loathing among those who see it or its home. Such possessions often lead to rivalries and sabotage within a chimera pride, as one chimera may steal the trophies of another only to destroy or hide them, or worse, claim the items as their own. Chimeras accusing others in the pride of stealing their things are generally regarded as sore losers by their kin, for true hunters never lose their prey. Their brutish and careless demeanors result in the foul beings breaking their toys more often than not, however, so chimeras are always searching for new trinkets and playthings.<\/br>Chimeras can easily be modified to resemble great cats other than lions, or horned beasts other than goats, especially if they\u2019re placed in an environment consonant with their specific features. For instance, a mountain- or arctic-dwelling chimera with a <\/br>An orthrus lacks wings and possesses a body that resembles a two-headed hound or <\/br>An orthrus does not have a fly speed, and replaces the <\/br>It\u2019s said that when the first chimera prototypes were created, their kind was made up of what eventually became legendary chimeras (one such creature is detailed at the end of this section) and orthruses. The legendary chimeras were all female, and orthruses were exclusively male. When the two mated, they occasionally produced chimeras and orthruses; more often, however, their offspring resembled neither parent, and were instead wicked, single-headed abominations. While their maker was satisfied with the wretched progeny, the chimeras grew malcontent and angry that their children were so deformed, hideous, and unlike them. They turned on their mates and began to devour them and their children alike. Seeing this, their creator decided to make the chimeras less headstrong, more adaptable, and able to see to their own reproductive needs. Orthruses quickly found themselves no longer needed and thus even further hated by these new chimeras, and so most retreated to the farthest reaches of the world, where the cruel chimeras would not hunt them down. There some still lurk, licking their wounds and seeking the occasional lone chimera to force themselves upon and mate with, spawning more of their kind and waiting for the day they can rise against their oppressors.<\/br>In Greek mythology, the chimera was a unique fire-breathing beast that terrorized the kingdom of Lycia in Asia Minor. Described by Hesiod and Homer as a tripartite creature melded from goat, lion, and serpent, she was one of the many Greek monsters spawned by Echidna and Typhon. Depending on the specific source, legends state she was either the sister or mother of the Sphinx and the Nemean lion.<\/br>The chimera figures most prominently in the legend of Bellerophon, who was commanded to hunt the beast by King Iobates of Lycia. This hunt was intended as an impossible task that would kill the hero, but after he tamed the flying horse, Pegasus, Bellerophon was able to fly out of reach of the Chimera\u2019s bite and breath, though he was still unable to wound the monster with his weapons. Feeling the monster\u2019s inner heat, Bellerophon mounted a block of lead on the end of his spear (in some versions of the story covering it with fat to entice the monster to bite and swallow it), and then lodged the weapon in the Chimera\u2019s gullet-the lead melted in her windpipe and suffocated her."},"Chuul":{"name":"Chuul","spell":[],"description":"Chuuls are armored, crustacean-like predators that lurk beneath the surfaces of shallow ponds and mires, bursting from concealment to snatch up prey in their chitinous pincers and then paralyzing them with their mouth tentacles before eating them alive.<\/br>Chuuls are excellent swimmers but prefer to attack land-bound creatures or those wallowing in shallow water.

Instead, chuul intellects seem entirely devoted to seeking out the perfect ambush sites to attack other intelligent creatures and decorating their elaborate lairs with trophies from their kills.

Degenerate inheritors of the half-remembered, collapsed cyclops civilizations, the stygiras\u2014or stone witches, as they are often called\u2014 command strange secrets of the earth and interpret the fateful energies of the depths. Ages of communion with the darkness and reliance upon alien magics have corrupted the stygiras from the primitive human witches their ancestors were countless ages ago, transforming them into a terrifying, debased breed infused with magics not their own. In many a savage land, these crones were once or are still worshiped as seers and demigods, weaving magic and communing with the earth to manipulate their servants into obeying their selfish and grotesque whims. In other realms, they haunt the night, prowling from their caves to feed upon the unwary or make alliances with those cruel and ambitious enough to believe their perverse counsel. Yet for all their perverse blasphemies and primitive desires, their powers to see what none should and reduce life to brittle stone proves enough to inspire dread and superstitious belief in nearly all who hear of the harsh stone witches. Stygiras on average stand 6-1\/2 feet tall and weigh approximately 150 pounds.<\/br>It is said that the stygiras draw their power from stone and from the darkness. Certainly they live their entire lives in the dark, traveling through intricate, maze-like caverns and the moonless sky with equal ease. They draw their sustenance from the base things they scrape from the earth\u2014vermin, molds, lichens, and whatever fleshy things happen into their lairs. Although technically blind, stygiras have almost supernaturally keen hearing, taste, and touch, and so have no need for sight. What remains of the eyes that lurk as vestigial elements of their anatomy hide beneath the scarred flesh of their faces. While such remnant organs typically go unused, they can still detect the presence of light, an uncomfortable sensation that all stygiras take great pains to avoid. Stygiras can in fact travel under the skies, but they quickly become agoraphobic and retreat to the safety of shadowy canyons or caves as soon as possible. They avoid the sunlight hours, with most willing to face death in the darkness rather than take their chances venturing into the light. All stygiras are female; they are capable of reproducing with humanoids of nearly any species and always bearing three or more withered\u2014and typically stillborn\u2014stygira young. Yet stygiras make up for their appallingly low live birth and survival rates with unnaturally long lifespans.

Some see these beings as malign manifestations of the lycanthropic curse\u2014the spirits of the infamous affliction itself\u2014while others know them as the deathly continuance of lives consumed by lycanthropy.

The victim\u2019s jaws extend and grow into jagged, wolfish fangs, while the brow thickens and the pupils widen to black pools that radiate a mad, feral stare. In this state, the vilkacis-possessed creature froths with the curse of lycanthropy and can pass the curse on as though it were a werewolf. Although such a possessed creature might pass on the infamous disease, its own transformation typically lasts only a matter of hours. A vilkacis is ever searching for stronger and more vicious hunters to use as tools in slaking its eternal bloodlust; if it finds a particularly promising host, it might visit and possess the favored body again and again for its rampages.<\/br>Vilkacis most commonly appear in areas where human settlements border or stand within wildernesses. While they are commonly associated with werewolves, the folklore of many nomadic and nature-worshiping societies contains stories of creatures whose descriptions bear strong resemblance to vilkacis. Most haunt the territories where they were created, staying within range of their canopic stones, and hunting within the lands they prowled in life. However, those with the ability to summon vilkacis usually attempt to direct them toward specific prey. This often proves a dangerous or even fatal proposition, however, and few reports exist of anyone successfully mastering a vilkacis.<\/br>While many vilkacis spontaneously arise under the light of the full moon from the remains of the most savage werewolves, some foul spellcasters seek out the corpses of such bestial murderers, attempting to enslave their spirits and harness their capacity for brutality to fulfill the spellcasters\u2019 dark whims. To do this, a spellcaster must prepare a canopic stone, a talisman that typically takes the form of a ceramic totem or amulet bound in silver. Upon creating this object, the bearer can summon a vilkacis once per day. The stone grants no control over the vilkacis, but the creature will not attack or attempt to possess the stone\u2019s bearer. Upon being summoned, the vilkacis turns its attention to the nearest creature other than the summoner, attempting to possess the creature\u2019s body and go on a murderous rampage. Using a canopic stone to summon a vilkacis is considered an evil act. Although many vilkacis are purposefully created and employed by evil spellcasters, some manifest spontaneously. These beings wander and rampage as they please, but still are bound to a talisman similar to a canopic stone. This spontaneously created artifact can be utilized by those who discover it and discern its importance in the same way as can a canopic stone created specifically to summon and control a vilkacis, and typically takes the form of the dead werewolf \u2019s skull, the silver weapon that killed the werewolf, or a talisman it bore in life."},"Warmonger":{"name":"Warmonger","spell":["planar ally","planar binding","planar binding","planar ally\u2019s"],"description":"Like the more powerful <\/br>In a demon infested land, a large number of warmonger wasps have been left to their own devices.

The canopy creeper resembles a mass of thickly knotted and twisted jungle vines that correspond to the colors and varieties of its native habitat. It has a larger knot of this tangle at its center mass, which also conceals a large, beak-like maw. The canopy creeper can spread itself over a broad area to resemble little more than this network of vines, or it can draw itself up into a large, coiled mass with its beak exposed.<\/br>The actual vines that coil together to form the canopy creeper are hundreds of feet long altogether in an adult specimen. When spread out, these tangles of vine cover an area 20 feet in diameter. They congregate into a mass approximately 10 feet in diameter when drawn in together. The mass of a canopy creeper weighs about 3,000 pounds in total. A canopy creeper can live for hundreds of years in a hospitable climate if sufficient sunlight and food sources are available.<\/br>Canopy creepers are plants naturally evolved to take advantage of their surroundings. They grow amid the lush foliage of jungles or rain forests where a diverse array of vine plants proliferates. The canopy creeper climbs up among the tree tops and intertwines its own vine-grown body with those that grow naturally, enabling it to gain control over the naturally occurring network of vines to use as a source of both defense and sustenance. While a canopy creeper does gain food and energy from photosynthesis, it cannot maintain its active metabolism when relying only on the nutrients gleaned from sun and rain. For maximum efficiency, it uses the vine tendrils that it gains control of to detect by scent, to entrap, and to draw prey toward itself. It is also able to use these vine tendrils to procure food as they draw the nutrient-rich fluids from creatures entangled within their embrace, which are then conveyed back to the controlling canopy creeper.<\/br>While the canopy creeper\u2019s primary method of attack is through its vine tendrils, it does have a large beak mouth composed of a hard, hornlike material. This beak is normally concealed within the center of its vine mass, but when creatures approach that prove able to resist its vine tendril attacks, the canopy creeper tries to draw them in close enough so that it can attack with its beak as well. It can consume prey with this mouth, but this is not its preferred method of feeding as most of the prey\u2019s fluids are lost as the beak tears the creature apart, resulting in fewer nutrients than if it were to feed solely through the vine tendrils.<\/br>A canopy creeper naturally mimics the appearance and growth of the types of vines that grow in its environment, so when one is concealed among the vine-tangled foliage above, it is difficult for even an experienced outdoorsman to detect. This is further exacerbated by the fact that it is usually hanging about 100 feet above the ground, making its appearance even more difficult to discern. Canopy creepers\u2019 preferred prey is Medium or larger creatures since these tend to hold more of the nutrient-rich fluids that the creepers feed upon; meanwhile, Small and smaller creatures\u2014such as small <\/br>Canopy creepers store a great deal of moisture from their normally wet habitat in their vine structures, making them difficult to burn. However, this fact, as well as their adaptation to warm climates, makes them particularly susceptible to cold attacks, which cause them to become brittle and prone to fractures in their vine structures.<\/br>A canopy creeper out of its habitat is a canopy creeper in serious trouble. The creature relies on the prolific presence of other vine growths to camouflage its presence and to provide an aerial habitat from which it can feed safely above most creatures that might prey upon it. As a result, if a canopy creeper is caught on the ground away from screening foliage, it flies into a berserk frenzy, lashing out with its beak as it attempts to make for the nearest tree or high ground to escape.<\/br>A well-fed canopy creeper buds once every 4 or 5 years and drops dozens of small seedlings to the ground.

And yet they continue to do so, driven by a twisted desire to rob others of the life they no longer enjoy.<\/br>The means by which mohrgs hunt, kill, and draw enjoyment from their activities can be likened to a perverse sort of game. Although many mohrgs keep trophies of their kills (see the Treasure section), the thrill that mohrgs get from hunting, tormenting, and killing their prey is derived from the same visceral love of power that drove them in life. As <\/br>Lacking the need to eat, drink, or sleep, mohrgs have little desire for large or elaborate dwellings. A lone mohrg maintains a small, usually lightless cave or room (if living in a building or dungeon), with just enough space for its collection of trophies. Some mohrgs even pursue academic studies, and keep books on anatomy or necromantic magic in their homes, but mohrg lairs are otherwise sparse, uninviting places without seating or a place to sleep. These are not, after all, creatures known for their hospitality.<\/br>Small groups of mohrgs sometimes gather together for protection, strength, and better access to killing opportunities; while one mohrg might fall to a lucky guard or a group of adventurers, a gang or mob of mohrgs has more of a chance to disable and slay armed warriors than a lone specimen. Mohrgs understand their common drive to kill, and can sometimes make elaborate plans to set up the perfect situation in which to do their work, but they almost never discuss tactics in combat. Rather, the most powerful mohrg (either physically strongest or the oldest) seeks out a target, and other mohrgs in the group choose their own prey. Mohrgs do not generally fight over kills, except when driven mad by their lust for the resulting rush of negative energy.<\/br>Mohrgs that find themselves in large communities do their best to blend in, hiding in sewers, catacombs, dungeons, or abandoned buildings.

They are, however, fond of collecting trinkets or trophies that remind them of their former lives; a mohrg that was once a vicious warrior might claim armor clasps or small weapons from its victims, while a former murderer who preyed on the upper classes might collect signet rings. Some mohrgs engage in this behavior without any real recollection of their lives, and amass a random assortment of possessions as a sort of compulsive behavior they cannot explain. A mohrg that does remember its mortal life often gathers items that remind it of its former profession or family, mementos of lost loves, or baubles that remind it of past glories\u2014particularly its murderous exploits.<\/br>If a mohrg possesses class levels, it sometimes seeks out items that augment its class abilities. Alternatively, it may eschew such items altogether, and instead focus on hunting down particular forms of prey\u2014this is especially true of mohrgs created by spellcasters. These undead often turn on their creators at the first opportunity, but although they may keep their former masters\u2019 spellbooks or magic items, they typically only keep such items around as mementos of their rebellion. Mohrgs rarely have any use for coins, gems, or other material wealth, subconsciously preferring to gather items that connect them to individuals in the living world rather than ones that might be useful for trade.<\/br>Mohrgs gain no satisfaction from bodily comforts and sensations. They do, however, possess two overwhelming drives, even when they have no memories of their mortal lives: the desire to survive and the lust to kill.

The avaricious appetite of aurumvoraxes has earned them the appellation \u201cgolden gorger\u201d among dwarves, who have lost more than a few miners to the dangerous beasts. <\/br> In battle, an aurumvorax latches onto its victim with its jaws and gouges savage wounds with its claws. It rarely looses its grip before it or its foe is dead. It typically attacks the nearest living creature regardless of size, and ignores any wounds it suffers at the hands of others until its prey is dead. <\/br> A typical aurumvorax is only 3 feet long but weighs more than 200 pounds, for it is densely packed with muscle and thick, sturdy bones. Its fur is golden, while its claws are black and sharp. Its weight relative to its body size makes it a poor swimmer, and most dislike crossing water, though they can trundle along the bottom of still or slow water if necessary. <\/br> Adult aurumvoraxes are impossible to train, but their offspring are valued for training as guard beasts. A healthy aurumvorax kit can be sold for 5,000 gp or more to a discerning buyer. Female aurumvoraxes rarely give birth to more than one offspring at a time, and are ferociously protective of their young. <\/br> An aurumvorax drags its prey back to its lair to consume at its leisure, and its bone-midden often contains valuable belongings from past kills. Uneaten precious metals, discarded gems, and well-chewed metal items can also be found in its warrens. Despite its metallic coloration, an aurumvorax is not vulnerable to attacks that target metal, such as heat metal or the touch of a rust monster\u2014in fact, aurumvoraxes easily kill and eat rust monsters, and some dwarf clans use aurumvorax pets to protect their storehouses against them.

The result: a creature that combines the best and worst traits of both of its parents. From a distance, a mantidrake is often mistaken for a normal manticore. Only when opponents close against it do they see that the creature is something different.<\/br>Mantidrakes like dragons are territorial predators and often claim a wide expanse of land as their hunting ground. Creatures that wander into a mantidrake\u2019s territory rarely go unnoticed, especially during the daylight hours when the mantidrake spends most of its time hunting. Slain prey is either devoured on the spot (if the mantidrake is hungry) or carried back to its lair and stored for later (or fed to the young if such creatures are present). Mantidrakes are generally solitary creatures though sometimes a pair may be encountered. Such an encounter is with a mated pair.<\/br>Female mantidrakes are just as common (or rare depending on how you classify this creature) as males and are just as likely to be encountered as both sexes are skilled hunters.

A nuckelavee is a living irony\u2014a carrier of disease and a spreader of corruption that unleashes its wrath against other sources that bring corruption into the world. The corruption spread by nuckelavees only serves to further their own sense of self-loathing and overall rage. While nuckelavees might, incidentally, carry out vengeance for the victims of such pollution, defending the denizens of their rivers, swamps, and bogs is not their primary drive, for they revel in inflicting the very corruption they hate and enjoy little more than watching their enemies sicken and die.<\/br>Folktales tell of talismans to carry\u2014fetishes of seaweed garlands, horsehair soaked in brine, or vials of sanctified seawater\u2014or of prayers to recite to ward away nuckelavees or convince them the bearer is innocent.

Horrifying, fleshless amalgams of man and horse, these monstrous avengers embody every wound and wickedness suffered by the wilds, their bodies loosing trails of gore and the pounds of their webbed hooves beating an inescapable threnody for all who earn their ire. Once they emerge from their refuges beneath cool waves or rivers, only destruction satisfies their merciless crusades, either that of their victims or their own.<\/br>Nuckelavees are strongly built and stand nearly 6 feet tall at their horse heads and about 9 feet at their humanoid heads, with a weight of nearly 2,000 pounds.<\/br>Nuckelavees spend most of their days asleep in flooded hollows and sea caves, waking only to gnaw on bitter sea plants and algae, their primary form of sustenance. With their unnatural metabolisms, nuckelavees can survive for weeks on only a few bites of aquatic plant life, and are content to lie in torpor for months or even years. Possessing a supernatural relationship with the waterways in which they reside, these bloody fey know when harm has befallen their home or its denizens. Often the damage proves obvious\u2014the dumping of wastes or toxic runoff, overfishing or kelp harvesting, or even less egregious offenses, like the construction of dams or waterwheels. Regardless of what sparks a nuckelavee\u2019s wrath, once one of these avengers\u2019 ire is garnered, it gallops forth not just to correct the offense, but repay the pain. Only once blood and tears have quenched the fires of a nuckelavee\u2019s rage does it willingly return to the water, often carrying with it some grisly trophy of its vengeance. Nuckelavees have no capacity to reproduce. The appearance of most proves a complete mystery and grim surprise, and the majority of their kind dwell in areas of pristine nature where rifts to the First World are known or likely.

Despite the monsters\u2019 obsession with defending natural waterways and the life therein, their interest seems to end at the shoreline. Nuckelavees have no interest in or apparent love for terrestrial beasts, especially those tamed and kept by the objects of their anger. Horses, cattle, and other livestock often prove the first casualties of a nuckelavee\u2019s rampage, with those that aren\u2019t left slaughtered in gory tableaus being infected with mortasheen and inevitably passing it on to their owners.<\/br>The tales of many lands tell of nuckelavees, typically emerging from seas and lakes to smite those who abuse nature or harm innocents\u2014depending on the storyteller\u2019s point of view. The majority of such tales arise from coastal and island communities, though the residents of many lake towns and those who live in lush river countries often warn of these deadly water monsters, blaming them for all manner of hardships. Such tales often include proscriptions for avoiding the bloody riders\u2019 wrath, local remedies for afflictions bestowed by the avengers, and ways one might banish a nuckelavee should they come face to face. In most cases, folktales tell of talismans to carry or prayers to recite to convince a nuckelavee that one is a friend\u2014or, at least, innocent of wrongdoing. Such talismans typically take the form of seaweed garlands, horsehair soaked in brine, or vials of sanctified seawater. Druids and priests of nature deities also supposedly possess the power to calm a nuckelavee\u2019s fury and convince it to return to the sea\u2014though typically only after it has dealt with those guiltiest of whatever offense roused it. When a nuckelavee first furiously emerges from the water, though, nothing short of the creature\u2019s destruction can compel a nuckelavee to return to its rest without taking a life.<\/br>It\u2019s rare for more than one nuckelavee to be found in the same region, as the creatures have little interest in one another.

Respected and admired for their wisdom and beauty, they try to steer mortals onto the right path and use their powers to fight evil, particularly those known to shift between the planes. Some couatls are viewed as benevolent gods by isolated societies, and while most couatls cringe at the thought of pretending to be a god, they allow such misconceptions to continue since they allow the couatls to guide and coax these societies onto paths of peace and cooperation with their neighbors. A couatl is about 12 feet long, with a wingspan of about 15 feet. It weighs 1,800 pounds.<\/br>As native outsiders, couatls must eat.

Yet it is not the serpents\u2019 beauty that makes them magnificent. Rather, the feathered serpents are most valued for their keen intellect, their close connection to the gods, and their fierce defense of all that is good and righteous.<\/br>Because of couatls\u2019 rarity and their tendency to travel while <\/br>The Plumed Ones-one of the many names given to them by their friends and disciples-take the most interest in guiding young or developing civilizations, for these societies are still malleable enough that their roots may be molded into a firm and just foundation for the generations to come, while older civilizations are often too large, corrupt, or set in their ways for a single voice (even the voice of a divine servitor) to make an impact. It is not surprising, then, that most tales of couatls and their works come from such cultures-jungle dwellers building their first city, nomadic tribes, burgeoning agrarian kingdoms, and the like. These cultures invariably see couatls as benevolent bringers of knowledge and guidance, and build temples and shrines in their honor, or portray the feathered ones in colorful frescoes or towering statuary. Some even come to worship the couatls as gods themselves, developing their own mythologies around the flying serpents. Though most couatls are deeply embarrassed by such veneration-especially when acting on behalf of an actual god-their code of ethics is rarely so stiff-necked that they feel compelled to dismiss the myths, instead seeing their deification as simply another tool they can use to steer the worshipers onto the path of justice and light. Peace and cooperation are two of the greatest goods a couatl can promote, and for such committed and upstanding creatures, couatls can sometimes be surprisingly flexible on tactics when it comes to advancing the greater good.<\/br>Members of more technologically advanced-or bloated and culturally stagnant-cultures rarely encounter couatls, and those who do are less likely to meet them as free agents searching for good to do in the world, and more likely to meet them in their roles as messengers, heralds, and servants of various good-aligned deities. Despite their impeccable reputation for honor and justice among those who know such things, the <\/br>Peaceful and soft-spoken, couatls rarely engage in violence against mortals, and then only in self-defense, seeking to disable and redeem their attackers rather than kill them outright.

Though they are at home on all planes of good <\/br>As they normally dwell in isolation, couatls have no real organized society. Though they may sometimes band together in the face of particularly difficult challenges, they prefer to seek allies from among the mortal races they serve and protect-doing so spreads couatls\u2019 influence wider and allows the <\/br>Couatls appear to have been created with a driving (some would say obsessive) desire to see both law and good triumph, as well as to see knowledge disseminated throughout the universe. One indication of this compulsion is couatls\u2019 perceived duty to educate and guide what they consider to be \u201cprimitive\u201d or \u201cundeveloped\u201d cultures. In this effort, couatls seek to show other people the benefits of righteous behavior before other, less benevolent forces can affect matters. Strangely enough, this education tends to be solely of a moral sort-because of their reverence for nature, couatls see no reason to help societies \u201cadvance\u201d economically or militarily, and indeed see a shift away from the natural rhythms of agriculture or hunting and gathering as a dangerous downhill slide into the corruption of an idle society.<\/br>An unfortunate side effect of couatls\u2019 desire to lift up other races, however, is their patronizing, paternal attitude toward others, which often comes across as arrogant. That this hubris is usually couched in warm and friendly terms does not lessen its impact-some individuals approached by a couatl reject its offers of assistance out of hand, offended by the feathered one\u2019s blatant condescension.<\/br>Best known as teachers, advisors, and guides, couatls approach potential beneficiaries carefully, observing from hiding for years or even decades before revealing themselves. Couatls are a proud race, and prefer to appear in their native form, as dramatically and impressively as possible, for in addition to their better qualities, most couatls are also quite vain. The appearance of a creature as magnificent as a couatl, framed by the rising sun or descending from a stormy sky, is enough to get almost anyone\u2019s attention, providing the couatl with the time and consideration it needs to offer aid and friendship to its chosen people. Older couatls, however, are usually more socially adept and less obviously proud, and have been known to appear in the guise of the race that they are contacting, especially if they are concerned about frightening or driving off their would-be beneficiaries.<\/br>Couatls are exceptionally intelligent, and guide their people patiently, as slowly or quickly as they deem necessary. Most of the time, the secrets they pass on pertain to utilitarian pursuits such as agriculture, animal husbandry, astronomy, architecture, sailing, fishing, and hunting, though most couatls are well read and willing to share far more esoteric knowledge as long as they believe it\u2019ll be put to positive use. Couatls also stress harmony and peace, making certain their gifts do not disrupt or damage the environment, or cause undue social upheaval.<\/br>Once a group has received a couatl\u2019s wisdom and is well on its way toward prosperity and civilization, the couatl usually departs, often with a promise to return one day should its people need assistance. In these cases, a couatl will sometimes leave a few of its feathers behind, magical talismans that may recall the couatl if needed. These feathers are also sometimes shared with the couatl\u2019s friends and allies in other worlds as well.<\/br>Though couatls often act as servitors for specific gods, they are strangely not particularly religious. Instead of worship-which, as many of them have seen firsthand, can be misdirected-they tend to view their patrons as valued (if distant) friends, and their service as a working relationship. Despite their rather rigid <\/br>As messengers, couatls may bring news, bits of wisdom, prophecies, or even warnings to evil rulers, sternly cautioning them against particularly destructive courses of action. In extreme cases, couatls may even be dispatched to aid the forces of good in combat, for the presence of a feathered one on the field of battle provides hope and encouragement to even the most dispirited soldier.<\/br>In most cases, couatls work best as creatures kept in the background, occasional patrons for the players or allies against particularly powerful foes. Good-aligned adventurers rarely find themselves in outright conflict with a couatl, though just because both the couatl and the PCs are essentially good doesn\u2019t mean they necessarily see eye to eye. A couatl, for instance, might look down on chaotic PCs\u2019 plans (or lack thereof), or it may see urban PCs\u2019 agendas as unintentionally harmful and corrupting toward the innocents it protects. If PCs in a campaign are outright evil, cruel, or reckless, of course, the feathered servant may take a more active role against them, recruiting defenders or facing them itself.<\/br>In low-level games, couatls are best used as either quest objects- with the PCs seeking out rumors of the feathered serpents in an effort to utilize their esoteric knowledge and wisdom-or mentors, providing the PCs with support, advice, and healing while suggesting potential missions that can aid the couatl in its conflict with evil forces.<\/br>At higher levels, couatls can be treated more as the PCs\u2019 equals-allies or companions sent by the gods to aid a party with particularly difficult or important endeavors. When not actively advising a culture, couatls normally dwell in great forests, on islands in the center of vast lakes, or in other beautiful and natural places of isolation, and this remains true even on other planes. High-level adventurers may encounter them during planar travel, where the feathered ones may provide advice and assistance or act as guardians and emissaries for the true masters of the plane.<\/br>It\u2019s exceedingly rare to encounter more than a single couatl at a time, though couatls sometimes travel with companions of various races, sworn companions who aid them in their missions. The presence of more than one couatl in a given area is a sure sign that a catastrophe is looming, or that the forces of evil are particularly strong and dangerous there.<\/br>Couatls have no use for treasure, and in fact are quick to point out material wealth as one of the surest roads to corruption and damnation. At the same time, they\u2019re not above utilizing magical items to further their cause, and will sometimes keep items of tribute with the intention of eventually returning them, redistributing such wealth as rewards to allies or stockpiling the treasures in anticipation of a coming crisis. Couatls\u2019 best-known treasure, however, is one that they produce themselves. Ordinary shed couatl feathers are exceptionally beautiful and can be sold for up to 100 gp, but a freely gifted couatl feather can be easily be worth 10 times that or more. A gifted feather is imbued with magical energy that ties it to the couatl, and if used as an additional material component for the <\/br>Couatl is a word in the Nahuatl language spoken by the Aztecs that simply means \u201cserpent.\u201d The great god Quetzalcoatl (feathered serpent) was known throughout ancient Mesoamerica, and was called Kukulcan by the Maya.

Some tales even claim that Quetzalcoatl created <\/br>The Aztecs and other cultures that worshiped the Feathered Serpent viewed Quetzalcoatl as having several forms, and in addition to anthropomorphic avatars (such as that of Ehecatl the wind god), he was known for the dragonlike feathered serpent form that fantasy gaming drew from to create the Pathfinder couatl."},"9-Headed":{"name":"9-Headed","spell":[],"description":"You can make more powerful hydras by increasing their Hit Dice\u2014each added HD increases the hydra\u2019s statistics as appropriate, but also gives it one additional head and a +1 increase to its natural armor.

To view the world through this great eye is enough to drive the unwary mad, and even those who can make use of such an eye as a dangerous relic think twice before consulting its otherworldly divinations.<\/br>In addition to common cyclopes, there exists a stronger, even more bestial breed known as great cyclopes. These shaggy brutes lack the rudimentary intelligence and gift of foresight their kin possess, but make up for these shortcomings with their terrifying strength and unpredictable bouts of horrendous rage. Their primitive nature and barbaric ferocity hark back to a simpler time among cyclops-kind, and scholars debate on the exact origins of these degenerate goliaths. Regardless of the exact reasons for the split between cyclopes and great cyclopes, the former know to fear and respect their larger kin, giving such behemoths a wide berth when encountering them in the wild. For their part, great cyclopes\u2014selfish and crude\u2014rarely associate with their weaker brethren or even their own kind, though they are easily swayed by gifts of food and treasure. Primitive or barbaric <\/br>For some worshipers, such adoration is all mysticism and superstition, with primitive shamans seeking insights and power from blood, viewing great cyclopes as prophesied destroyers sent from the heavens. For others, such veneration truly does offer revelations into the lost ways and powers of the cyclopes, revealing\u2014and in some rare cases granting a measure of mastery over\u2014those forgotten secrets. Still others merely disguise their own cruelties and ambitions in the cloak of faith, drawing influence and might from false ceremonies and the favor of brutal giants they seek to twist to their will. Whatever their form, cyclops cults all dwell on the mysteries of insight, the future, the heavens, and the symbolic eye.<\/br>Although their empires have long fallen to the more fecund races that populate much of the world, cyclopes still remain prominent in some pockets of wilderness. The majority lair in the remote, primeval reaches of the world in small conclaves of six or fewer\u2014though such groups often grow into fully fledged tribes given enough time. Possessing but a shadow of their former ambitions, many cyclopes dwell in primitive caves with rudimentary furnishings and tools, giving nary a thought to the near-mythic triumphs of lost ages, instead content with protecting their lairs and seeking out their next meals. Still, their ever-present gift of clouded prophecy serves as a constant, hazy reminder of what was once theirs and what could be again, though only the wisest among their kind know how to interpret such clouded visions.<\/br>While small groups of cyclopes usually share the responsibility of protecting the group and seeing to its needs, tribes and larger confederations of cyclopes tend to construct simple hierarchies. The most common form of ruler among small cyclops societies is the tribal chief, a leader known in some cyclops circles as the tyrant. Individual cyclopes rise to tyranny within their tribes by exhibiting the most strength over weaker creatures, typically in the heat of battle. Cyclopes enjoy taking slaves, and place great value on the individual thralls they accumulate throughout their violent lives. Stealing or eating another cyclops\u2019s slave is the best way to shame a member of a cyclops tribe, though such depredations are also quick to spur intertribal conflicts.<\/br>Cyclopes possess only the crudest forms of agriculture when they attempt it at all, usually restricting such menial labor to the herding of easily domesticated <\/br>Even the most learned of cyclopes know relatively little about their ancestors and the ancient empires that once belonged to their people.

Regardless of their dim-wittedness compared to their ancient ancestors, the <\/br>Cyclopes work best as enigmatic figures of myth and legend, placed in the path of adventurers to distill eldritch knowledge or to lure the PCs toward places of antiquity with the promise of forbidden treasure. They often inhabit ancient ruins and the remains of long-forgotten kingdoms, and so dungeon-delving PCs will likely come into contact with these one-eyed behemoths eventually. To cyclopes, such crumbling markers of history are hallowed sites that serve as windows to the past. Many an adventuring company has scoured the ruins of an ancient civilization in search of lost treasure, but few have paused to ponder the peoples who constructed these crumbling edifices and their unknown purposes. A cyclops encounter serves as a great plot device to introduce PCs to the storied legacy of the ancient world without it feeling like a history lesson. A notable cyclops NPC might appear again and again throughout a campaign, either as a recurring villain or as an agent seeking aid from the PCs, perhaps in the form of retrieving some relics or artifacts pertaining to a cyclops empire\u2019s mysterious past.<\/br>Though their intentions may appear benign, at heart most cyclopes are callous creatures who view <\/br>Cyclopes treasure their weapons above all other items, viewing their over-sized greataxes, mauls, and clubs as extensions of their own rage and strength.

Far from being a danger to the beasts, these bubbling crevices spew a form of magma that imbues gargiyas with incredible abilities. From birth, gargiyas ingest magma bubbling up from the ocean floor. By the time they\u2019ve reached maturity, the monsters develop a molten core in their gullets that allows them to call forth scalding heat at will.

While it\u2019s unclear just how it lends gargiyas such power, scholars agree that this magma serves as gargiyas\u2019 primary sustenance and as the source of their hyperthermal abilities.<\/br>Scholars believe that as gargiyas became more adept at manipulating heat, they became more protective of the magma vents they call home. Whereas early legends speak of gargiyas that rarely surfaced, preferring to stay close to their volcanic lairs, modern stories tell of gargiyas that see any sentient creatures\u2014even if they\u2019re sailing a mile away\u2014as threats to be met head-on. The few sailors who have survived these encounters warn of gargiyas that actively patrol the waters surrounding their magma vents, surfacing at even the slightest sign of unlucky passersby.

When the female returns to her lair, she is thought to consume large amounts of magma while her single snakeling gestates, usually for a period of about 10 years. When giving birth, the gargiya expels her offspring into a magma-spewing fissure, where it grows and gathers strength until it leaves to find its own home. Although there is some debate about gargiyas\u2019 longevity, scholars believe they typically live around 300 years.

Intelligent and powerful, saumen kars are not naturally aggressive, but the hostility of their environment forces them to defend the land that supports them with ferocity, even to the death. Their natural coloration and snow-packed fur make saumen kars almost invisible among the drifts of their icy homes, leading many arctic races to refer to them as \u201cmen of snow.\u201d A long-forgotten deal made by their race in its infancy still brutally scars the body of each saumen kar, marking them with their distinctive frostbite brands\u2014though if this debt is already paid, lapsed, or growing ever greater, none can remember. An adult saumen kar stands 12 feet tall and weighs almost 2,000 pounds, but the ice and snow matted to its fur for both insulation and armor add another 1,000 pounds to its bulk.<\/br>These solitary creatures are nomadic, roaming the wastes to settle temporarily where they are lucky enough to find food, shelter, or both. They are omnivorous, but the climate dictates that the lion\u2019s share of their diet is meat, and saumen kars consume the flesh of any creature but their own kind.<\/br>Generation to generation, saumen kars pass down the ice crafting techniques that supply them with weapons, tools, and art. Occasionally a saumen kar\u2019s lair contains crude ice replicas of common implements, from storage jars to skinning tools, or even heavy-lidded ice chests. Finding their frozen works among the possessions of another race is rare, however, since saumen kar ice artifacts rarely last long outside of arctic environments.<\/br>The crude frostbite brands that mark every adult saumen kar\u2019s flesh are the gruesome expression of an ancient pact with an otherworldly being, still honored by saumen kars for both spiritual and practical reasons. The specifics of the pact are long forgotten, but some elders believe the men of snow protect something in the wastes that they have themselves forgotten. While the meaning of the brands may have become lost to their wearers, scholars of language recognize the runes as a form of ancient Giant. Even still, only one well versed in linguistics can identify the sole rune still rendered well enough to read: \u201cfavored.\u201d The runes\u2019 powers lead many to believe the saumen kars owe their protection to one of the numerous powers of the north or entities mysterious to natives of more temperate lands, though the implication of the runes being an ancient form of the Giant language also creates an unsettling link between these arctic warriors and the Deathless Frost. Whichever way other races choose to speculate, the saumen kars believe the brands\u2019 protections come from their reverence for the deadly forces of the world\u2019s summit, and they display their scars proudly, wearing no clothing or armor but the snow matted into their dense fur.<\/br>The saumen kars have learned that survival is best achieved alone or in very small groups. It is rare to meet more than one of their kind at a time, although folklore does tell of handfuls of saumen kars banding together against a particularly serious or wide-ranging threat. Wandering the wastes alone, they throw up temporary lairs wherever food or ice cliffs can be found, moving off when they have taken what they can from the land. A typical lair is little more than a rough-walled igloo or ice cave built by hefting large amounts of snow and packing it tight around the hemispheres of ice they create, before the magical effect expires.<\/br>Saumen kars\u2019 antisocial behavior is what keeps them rare, and indeed mating is almost incidental, occurring when a male\u2019s and favorably disposed female\u2019s paths happen to cross. New families rarely stay together for long, and for a creature with a lifespan of up to 300 years, their offspring grow at an alarming rate, and learn to fend for themselves early in life.<\/br>Saumen kars worship the land and the powers of the north rather than any specific deity, leading to a druidic dominance of their spiritual lives. In their final days, some saumen kars travel to sites of great natural beauty or power to die in a place where the blackened bones of many generations are tumbled together beneath ever-shifting ice and snow. From what little outsiders can gather, they are a loosely shamanic people, and some carry crude family reliquaries of teeth, bones, and fur for ancestral protection and guidance.<\/br>Saumen kars speak a dialect of Giant influenced by Druidic, though they rarely communicate with other races. Some saumen kars, through necessity, have picked up smatterings of other languages and even a word or two of Common, but their knowledge of such languages never extends beyond a handful of crude threats and warnings.<\/br>Survival in the wastes is about understanding its dangers, environmental or otherwise, and despite their primitive, animalistic appearance, saumen kars are canny combatants. Over thousands of years their proud race has learned patience and silence from the glaciers. Rather than risk a frontal assault, they utilize their natural coloration to hide in snow banks and their ability to summon powerful ursine aid to scare off enemies or track those who trespass upon their lands. Only if interlopers prove a match for their summoned allies will they cautiously join the fray, trapping physically stronger creatures in icy hemispheres or separating groups with freezing planes. They then wade in, the field rearranged to their advantage, to use their imposing size, savage axe blows, and incapacitating headbutts to cut down weaker opponents, or take snowstorm form to shred dangerous spellcasters with blinding, razor-sharp sleet."},"Forgefiend":{"name":"Forgefiend","spell":["earth glide","pass without trace","major image","passwall","shatter","stone shape","deeper darkness","dimensional anchor","flesh to stone","produce flame","wall of fire","wall of stone","produce flame"],"description":"Scanderigs, more commonly known as \u201cforgefiends,\u201d look like large, heavily armored, barrel-shaped <\/br>Forgefiends are particularly feared in many dwarven societies.

In 24 hours, the chemicals in the spittle harden it into an impenetrable sheath that protects ursikkas from brutal summer heat. Shortly after their spittle-cocoons harden, the beasts go dormant and do not awake until the temperature returns to a more tolerable level.<\/br>Although ursikkas are known for aggressiveness during the entirety of winter, they are at their most volatile right before and right after dormancy. An ursikka that is interrupted while weaving its cocoon immediately attempts to kill the intruders. An ursikka whose cocoon is broken during the summer emerges similarly enraged; ursikkas that defeat the creatures responsible for waking them attempt to reconstruct their cocoons, but as spittle production ceases during hibernation, those efforts often fail. Some natives actively seek out the cocoons of slumbering ursikkas, knowing they can defeat the exposed beasts relatively easily.<\/br>With their ruthless predatory skills and voracious appetites, ursikkas typically live solitary existences. However, in places where prey is abundant, ursikkas sometimes live in pairs or, rarely, in small hives of three to 10. In such cases, ursikkas still hunt alone. Scholars note that the creatures don\u2019t hesitate to kill each other should one steal another\u2019s meal.<\/br>In accordance with their long life cycles, ursikkas mate infrequently.<\/br>Once or twice each winter, the larger females of the species typically seek out mates as determinedly as they hunt prey. Afterward, each female lays one enormous, fertilized egg made of a secretion similar to the creatures\u2019 hardened saliva. After a 5-year gestation period, the egg hatches. If ursikka parents are even aware of their offspring, though, their behavior does not indicate it.<\/br>According to scholars, young ursikkas grow to maturity in fewer than 10 years. One disturbing speculation indicates that adult ursikkas sometimes enjoy the flesh of their younger counterparts\u2014and may actually hunt juvenile members of their own species if prey becomes scarce. Whether this behavior is simply a way for adult ursikkas to survive or a warped way for them to retain their territorial dominance is unknown.<\/br>Although they are very long-lived, ursikkas rarely live through more than two winters. In the planet\u2019s most isolated territories, where few predators or stalwart hunters threaten them, ursikkas typically die of old age during their dormant period; ursikka carcasses swathed in shimmering, deteriorating cocoons are not uncommon in these frontiers. In more populated areas, ursikkas\u2019 lifespans are shorter, especially given the hardy, cold-forged winter cultures that hunt the creatures for protection, thrills, and sometimes meat. Indeed, the warriors of the most populous nations consider a slain ursikkas\u2019 claws, mandibles, and bulbous eyes the ultimate hunting trophies.

Hunched and twisted, a vrykolakas\u2019s bent spine is the same length it was in life if straightened, but the feral posture of most cause them to slump to a mere 4-1\/2 to 5 feet tall. The wasting of death also greatly decreases the corpse\u2019s weight, reducing even hearty men to at least 20 or 30 pounds less than they weighed in life.<\/br>Despite its savage and decayed appearance, a vrykolakas often passes through towns and villages undeterred, due to its supernatural ability to disguise itself. With the ability to cloak its terrible shape, a vrykolakas typically appears little different than it did in life. Death removes much of the living corpse\u2019s sense of who it was, though, so vrykolakas rarely reconstruct their original appearances with complete accuracy. Thus, family and acquaintances often notice the resemblance, but do not readily identify a vrykolakas as the resurrected individual.<\/br>A vrykolakas thrives upon disease and death, drawing its vigor from those humanoids it passes near. It walks among the living merely to infect them with its grave taint, passing on the subtle corruption of death. Its mere touch drains the life from a victim as well, stealing from its very essence. A vrykolakas\u2019s favored victims typically come from among its former family members and friends, which it pursues with only half a memory of any previous connection, yet a lingering malice, as such former companions failed to prevent its accursed fate.<\/br>A vrykolakas is uniquely bound to the place where it died or its body was originally interred. It must return to this site every Starday and bury itself amid the earth or stones to rest for 24 hours. A vrykolakas is entirely helpless during this period and can be easily destroyed if it can be located. The vampire-kin understand this weakness, though, and go to great lengths to avoid being followed to their resting places.<\/br>Vrykolakas typically appear near or in rural areas close to their graves. They walk the open streets of villages and hamlets during daylight hours, avoiding direct interaction and attention, all the while infecting those nearby and robbing them of their vitality. By night they seek to take their revenge more overtly, wreaking havoc upon the community, destroying food and property, attacking and smothering people in their beds, stealing valuables, and generally terrorizing people. Many rural superstitions and prejudices against strangers stem from tales of vrykolakas, slipping quietly into town or lurking at the edges of a community, spreading death and despair among the innocent.<\/br>The vrykolakas (pronounced \u201cvree-KO-la-kahss\u201d) is an undead creature from Greek folklore. Synonymous with revenants, these terrors manifest as humans that have returned from the grave to perform some act before they can peacefully rest. Many stories of the vrykolakas are not of horrid, evil undead, but of deceased persons attempting to return to their former lives, such as the shoemaker who returned from the grave to mend his children\u2019s shoes, carry water, and chop firewood.<\/br>The more vengeful type of vrykolakas gained stronger belief in Greece after the arrival of Slavic immigrants, who brought with them tales of blood-drinking vampires and werewolves. The word vrykolakas itself borrows from Slavic, derived from the Bulgarian word vukodlak, vuk meaning \u201cwolf \u201d and dlaka meaning \u201cfur.\u201d This suggests that vrykolakas were somehow associated with werewolves, most likely due to the Slavic belief that werewolves became vampires after they died. A person could become a vrykolakas in a variety of ways. The most common involve a person being evil and immoral, an excommunication from the church, or improper burial rites. Some thought that eating the meat of a sheep that had been killed or wounded by a wolf or a werewolf would turn a person into a vrykolakas.<\/br>A cat or other animal jumping over a dead body could also result in its evil return. Curses, such as \u201cmay the ground not receive thee,\u201d would also condemn the recipient to undeath as a vrykolakas. Many also believed that a vrykolakas would knock at your door and call your name, but could only do so once. If one answered the door, he would die shortly thereafter, and become a vrykolakas. For this reason, the superstition that one should not answer the door until the second knock still exists in some Greek villages."},"Whale":{"name":"Whale","spell":[],"description":""},"Woodwose":{"name":"Woodwose","spell":["entangle","pass without trace","shillelagh","speak with plants","wood shape","blight","transport via plants","wall of thorns","ironwood","tree shape","insect plague","giant vermin","rusting grasp","contagion","dominate animal","snare","barkskin","chill metal","fire trap","flaming sphere","heat metal","detect animals or plants","endure elements","faerie fire","magic stone","summon nature\u2019s ally","detect magic","flare","guidance","know direction","read magic","resistance","wall of thorns"],"description":"The woodwose or green men are wicked male counterparts of the dryad.

Some scholars have pointed out that specific details of these magical rituals have certain traits in common across all schools of magic and faith, leading some to believe that the ability to create devourers may have been introduced long ago as a single spell, perhaps provided by whatever malign forces lurk beyond the planes.<\/br>Another unusual facet of devourers\u2019 existence is their strange response to a host of different spells, both powerful and weak. When one of these particular spells\u2014mostly banishments or charms and compulsions\u2014is cast on a devourer, there\u2019s a chance that it instead causes the devourer to lose its hold on whatever spirit it has trapped in its chest, allowing the captive to escape off to its designated afterlife. No one is entirely sure why this is; perhaps the mind-affecting effects interact strangely with whatever madness or alien compulsions already drive the devourers, or the banishments can\u2019t figure out where to send a creature that is effectively from beyond the planes. What is known, however, is that on those rare occasions when devourers have been cast back out to the space beyond reality, they have always found their way back with shocking ease.<\/br>Like a black stain upon the proper flow of souls in the cosmos, devourers face revulsion from most other beings. They forsake their own spiritual evolution for undeath, and opportunistically feed upon other souls.

Devourers are pragmatic to the extreme and highly secretive, but willing to serve greater masters should it serve their needs and offer a way to advance their current fixation.<\/br>Without occasionally feeding, devourers lose the use of their magical abilities, though in reality, the fact that a devourer can survive without a trapped soul for indefinite periods of time makes the \u201cfeeding\u201d analogy break down. Instead, souls are simply capsules of energy that can be stored and used up, like batteries. It is perhaps for this reason that a devourer feeding has no orgiastic or sacramental aspect to it.

Though devourers never discuss just who or what they\u2019re talking to, many suspect their madness rises from a lingering connection to whatever sinister, alien entity or force made them what they are, and the devourers themselves sometimes let apparent titles slip, with appellations like the Dire Shepherd or the Wanderer Upon the Stair.<\/br>For all their madness, and despite their capacity for soul-annihilation, devourers are not creatures of mindless hunger, rampaging across the land. Instead they wander the planes, taking up new souls as needed but generally paying little attention to most other creatures, simply because their minds are elsewhere, occupied with more important things. The exception to this arises when devourers run across those individuals who, for one reason or another, play into their alien goals. Should they turn out to be foes, devourers show no mercy and leave nothing in their wake, not even the whispers of the dead.<\/br>Ultimately, devourers\u2019 role in the cosmos remains a mystery, revealed individually and on a timescale not rushed by mortality.

Covered with a dense pelt of shaggy white fur, the gnoph-keh is equally at home walking on two, four, or six legs. The creature prefers to travel on all six when using its powerful charge or running, but rears up on its hind legs in combat to bring its four front claws to bear on its foes. With the gnophkeh\u2019s ability to call up and direct powerful blizzards matched to its ability to move and see in such conditions without any disadvantage, the creature is rightfully feared in the frozen realms where it dwells.<\/br>The gnoph-keh is, and always has been, a beast of the frozen white realms. Temperatures above freezing are uncomfortable to the gnoph-keh, to the extent that prolonged exposure to warm or hot temperatures can actually kill this mighty creature. Its aura of cold helps to protect it somewhat when it ventures into temperate areas, but once in a subtropical or similarly heated environment, the monster\u2019s freezing body cannot compensate\u2014its flesh begins to literally melt, as if it were composed of ice and snow. The gnoph-keh has watery blue blood, and as it melts, this pale f luid runs in copious, steaming gouts from its body, inflicting severe pain on the creature. Accounts of gnoph-kehs being driven to blind rage in such conditions and simply attacking all nearby creatures and objects with no attempt to seek safety are likely apocryphal, since a gnoph-keh presented with such extreme temperatures generally does everything in its power to flee. They can use their ability to create blizzards to delay this fate, but in hot areas, the fact that this ability lasts only a minute usually only postpones the inevitable.<\/br>Although once much more numerous, gnoph-kehs today are spread quite thin through the frozen wastelands and mountain heights they prefer to dwell in. This, combined with the creatures\u2019 long gestation period, means that few gnoph-kehs are born. The monsters are exceptionally long-lived, with all indications that they can survive for centuries, or even millennia, if not slain by sickness or violence. Gnoph-kehs typically only seek out others of their kind for two reasons\u2014to mate (an event that generally happens only once a century for any single gnoph-keh) or to make war. Gnoph-kehs are hermaphrodites, capable of fertilizing others of their kind while also capable of becoming pregnant (although they cannot fertilize themselves). Despite its resemblance to a mammal, the gnoph-keh does not birth live young\u2014instead, it lays a clutch of a dozen or so furry eggs that it buries in the snow or in the ice of a glacier. As the eggs grow, they slowly absorb each other until finally only a single egg remains. The creature inside doesn\u2019t hatch as much as it simply absorbs the leathery, furry sphere that surrounds it, transforming into a fully grown gnoph-keh.<\/br>The primary driving force behind gnoph-keh society is war\u2014not between themselves, but against other creatures that share their realms. Whether this drive to wage war is rooted in a strange psychological need, spurred by racial memories of the creatures\u2019 interactions with even more hostile races in the distant past, or something else entirely, there can be no denying that the gnoph-kehs enjoy the act of spreading misery to other races\u2014particularly to humanoids. The only times a gnophkeh interacts with one of these \u201clesser races\u201d is to subjugate it for the purposes of establishing an army that the gnoph-kehs can then use against similar races, for the only thing that eclipses a gnoph-keh\u2019s lust for warfare is the delight in turning tribes against each other. Once one tribe wipes out all of its competitors, the inevitable result is the final destruction of the victorious tribe by its own hateful commander. In this way, a single gnoph-keh can eradicate far larger groups than it would normally be able to destroy on its own.<\/br>While gnoph-keh society may seem monolithic to humanity, this is largely due to the simple fact that most of humanity\u2019s interactions with the gnoph-kehs are in the framework of pain and death. And while gnoph-kehs do not usually gather in groups or build cities, there is evidence that this is not always the case in certain strange and ancient ruins found in frozen corners of the world. Most gnoph-kehs spend their time alone in contemplation or worship of strange statues they carve from glaciers or frozen lakes. The countenances of these gnoph-keh gods are alien and frightening. Very few gnoph-keh clerics or other divine spellcasters exist, prompting some scholars to theorize that these statues are in fact effigies of a long-forgotten and even more terrible force\u2014perhaps the same one that nearly drove the gnoph-kehs into extinction so long ago and instilled in their minds such an overwhelming predisposition for war."},"Witch-Doll":{"name":"Witch-Doll","spell":["discern location","confusion","slow","mending","discern location","geas\/quest","limited wish","polymorph any object"],"description":""},"Dreamthief":{"name":"Dreamthief","spell":["see alignment","dream council","dream scan","dream travel","detect magic","see alignment","deep slumber","etherealness","invisibility","magic missile","alter self","beast shape II","miracle","wish","etherealness"],"description":"These more powerful cousins of <\/br>While few denizens of any plane trust dreamthief hags, some welcome them as merchants.

Whenever potential prey nears a jinmenju, it wills its fruit to prematurely begin the rotting process. In addition to enticing its prey with hallucinations, a jinmenju can instantly ferment its head-fruits, emitting a sweet, intoxicating odor that lures creatures to the tree and captivates them. Those who have tasted a head-fruit and lived to tell of the experience claim that the fruit\u2019s flesh has a mushy consistency that makes it hard to hold in one\u2019s hands, and as it slips from one\u2019s grip, the world seems to melt away as well.<\/br>Jinmenjus are remarkably intelligent and versatile plants, and can augment their illusions by creating sounds to further convince creatures that the false images they are seeing are real as they near the trees\u2019 head-fruits. By making minute alterations to the structure of its dense but flexible bark, a jinmenju can produce a series of cracks, shudders, and pops that can be combined to imitate almost any sound, including a creature\u2019s voice or bursts of noise capable of damaging and deafening the tree\u2019s enemies. While a jinmenju can communicate in the common language of those it most often encounters, it rarely does so unless it has been given a suitable gift or is forced to speak by some other means.<\/br>Jinmenjus are found primarily in hilly and mountainous regions, far from any civilization whose residents might seek to put an end to such a deceptive and ravenous creature.

Lukwatas are enormous, insatiably carnivorous creatures that hunt the oldest rivers and lakes of the most eldritch jungles. Some say they favor the dark, owing to their genesis amid vast seas, but even if this is true, light doesn\u2019t deter them in their relentless pursuit of prey. Their long flat bodies are reminiscent of those of dolphins or large fish, but their heads are distinctively eel-like, and their prominent teeth quickly identify them as dangerous predators. A lukwata\u2019s hide is thick and mottled, ranging from muddy brown to a tarnished copper color. Females are known to have dark blue spots along either side of the dorsal ridge, below the fin. Lukwatas grow to over 20 feet in length, and their dense bodies can weigh over 4,000 pounds.<\/br>Lukwatas prowl the rivers and lakes of jungles and tropical swamps. They primarily feed on fish and waterbirds, but lukwatas\u2019 low, flat bodies allow them to prey on land dwelling creatures that approach the water\u2019s edge to drink or cross to the opposite shore. When making such attacks, a lukwata uses its over-sized jaws to grab its victim and then fling it into the water, making it easier prey. Capable of snapping ship timbers and cutting through the muscle, sinew, and bone of giraffes and even hippos in a single bite, lukwatas\u2019 jaws can grapple or toss creatures of almost unthinkable size into the water to be eaten. Because of their size and strength, lukwatas are also particularly dangerous to vessels and can capsize them with unsettling ease. Fortunately, they do not often mistake watercraft for prey, but swimming creatures and violent motion on the water (such as fast paddling or combat) can easily draw their attention.<\/br>Lukwatas hate crocodiles, their chief predatory rivals, and attack them on sight, even if the lukwata has recently fed. Most crocodilians are not large enough to pose a significant threat; however, some accounts do exist of lukwatas and dire crocodiles crossing paths. These fights are renowned for their destructiveness, with the embattled creatures destroying piers, flotillas, and even dams in their fury.<\/br>An unknown substance in the lukwata\u2019s bloodstream attracts magical energy from the surrounding area. This energy mixes with the silt and sand passing normally through the creature\u2019s system to create small, crystalline nodes along the lukwata\u2019s digestive track. Functioning as gallstone-like encrustations aiding in the digestion of food, these nodules also infuse a lukwata\u2019s body with an aura that disrupts magic brought into contact with the creature. As a result, spells often bounce harmlessly off the monster\u2019s hide, and victims of the lukwata\u2019s bite can have even the most potent magical wards dispelled.<\/br>Lukwatas form mated pairs annually and for a brief period only. During the mating season, females produce large quantities of eggs along river bottoms and lakebeds. The males follow afterward and fertilize the eggs, which then float to the surface and hatch. The survival rate for these eggs is extremely low, as they are considered a delicacy by local fishermen and are a source of food for other predators. A female lukwata produces over 1 million eggs in a lifetime in an effort to combat this harsh reality.<\/br>The lukwata is said to inhabit Lake Victoria and other large Ugandan lakes. Accounts of the creature differ, with some witnesses claiming that it can grow to a length of 100 feet or more. Although some accounts describe the creature as having a long, plesiosaurus-like neck, most locals describe it as a dolphin-like creature with a square head and jaw. Locals also believe that battles between the lukwata and crocodiles, said to be natural enemies, cause the lukwata to lose fragments of bone. If recovered, these shards are believed to have magic powers. Although a handful of sightings have been reported, Lake Victoria\u2019s relatively young geological age rules out the likelihood that the lukwata is a prehistoric creature that has survived to the present day. Some locals of Lake Victoria and scientists have theorized that the lukwata is an extremely large variety of catfish or eel, noting that the extreme depth and abundance of food in the large lakes of East Africa could easily support such creatures."},"Deadly":{"name":"Deadly","spell":[],"description":"The legendary deadly mantis stalks the deepest jungles.

The implantation happens via the gongorinan\u2019s mouth and a hideous ovipositor that\u2019s not quite tongue and not quite toothed prolapsing throat, but something worse. Fortunately for most who might encounter a gongorinan, the process of oviposition leaves the horrid creature open to attack and cannot be performed quickly, yet to the lone adventurer caught and overwhelmed by a gongorinan, this is small comfort indeed.<\/br>Once an egg has been implanted, it takes many days to grow, and the gongorinan prefers to carry the unfortunate host off to restrain it in a hidden location. Victims are often cocooned in webs or left stranded in high cavern ledges far above the ground so that the egg can gestate. As it grows, the egg feeds on the victim\u2019s mind, absorbing the victim\u2019s intellect until it has reduced the host to a drooling wreck.

To them, violence and mayhem are somewhere between a sport and a mode of criticism. If a fey lord chops the head off one of his knights, it might be little more than a dramatic rebuke. Therefore, the creatures known as ankous should not be considered simple killers. Their duty is not merely to kill\u2014it is to terrify and torture, to wring every iota of suffering out of their target in a pageant of cruelty before the final act, the bloody murder itself. Ankous are the servants of powerful fey nobles who rule with cold-iron fists, and whose subjects live in terror of a visit from the dark ones.<\/br>Physically, ankous are a fearful sight\u2014that is, when they permit themselves to be seen, instead of blinding their foes with darkness. The ankous themselves never speak\u2014the only words they can utter are those whispered telepathically into the victim\u2019s ear an instant before death, and those words are spoken in the voice of the one who sent the killer. A typical ankou measures approximately 10 feet tall, and about 8 feet across its ebon wings. Exceedingly light, the dark fey seem to be made of little more than shadows and gossamer, weighing less than 100 pounds.<\/br>Ankous exist to mete out the displeasure of their masters. The wounds caused by its wings and tail are especially agonizing, and victims have described little shards of crystalline moonlight cutting their way through muscle and bone underneath the skin. The blood-drenched skin of the victim of an ankou occasionally seems to shimmer or sparkle as if from residual moonlight in the corpse. Regardless of whether or not such dreadful whimsy is true, the wounds dealt by an ankou\u2019s tail and wings prove particularly vicious, leaving some victims to slowly bleed out from what appears to be nothing more than a mere scratch.<\/br>The fey\u2019s most horrific power, though, is its ability to conjure lesser shadows of itself. The assassin can create duplicates to aid in its attack. A single ankou can block all the exits from a chamber, ripping a victim to shreds with a flurry of slashes from the same claw. These conjured fey are born of shadow and wrath, and are of one mind with the ankou that created them. These lesser copies vanish when the true ankou is killed or is otherwise unable to maintain its focus. Only powerful Eldest can block an ankou\u2019s generation of duplicates.<\/br>Ankous have no true culture of their own. When not hunting a foe, an ankou slumbers in a cocoon of darkness amid the most shadowy reaches of the First World. They are rarely called to service by their fey masters, as the mere threat of an ankou is often enough to terrify even the most fearless enemy. When loosed upon an especially hated foe, one of these assassins might be told to kill the victim many times over\u2014murdering its target, waiting for its connection to the First World to reform it, and then killing it again.<\/br>Amid the courts of the Eldest, ankous typically lurk as present but needless threats\u2014like weapons hung in a royal hall. While the Eldest themselves prove more than capable of dispatching those who displease them, the flocks of ebon-winged fey nonetheless prove disturbing. What most nonfey typically have difficulty understanding is the lack of malice inherent in assassinations meted out by ankous. On the First World, such acts shock and annoy, but they don\u2019t equate to the ultimate punishment that death presents to mortals of the Material Plane. Thus, these grim tormenters of the First World take on new aspects of terror when encountered by non-natives of that realm.<\/br>In the unlikely event that an ankou\u2019s master is permanently killed, the murderous fey wanders as it will. Moody and quick to take offense\u2014whether from the pestering of other inquisitive fey or from trespassers into lands it deems its own\u2014a free ankou proves even more murderous than one employed as an assassin, though far less concerned with repeated murders. Typically they prefer to be left in silent solitude, brooding amid ancient ruins, crumbling castles of forgotten fey lords, or other morbid demesnes. They take particular umbrage at those who bring light or, even worse, song into their dour realms, often resorting to brief tortures before slaying such interlopers.

While a phoenix would never dream of using such foul items for its own purposes, upon occasion a cursed relic takes hold of a well-meaning phoenix\u2019s mind; such mesmerized beasts can prove to be terrible blights on nearby settlements. A phoenix makes sure to destroy the relic at fault if ever released from its hold-such enchanted individuals are exceedingly thankful to their saviors, and often allow the heroes in question to claim any item from their lair of treasures as a reward.<\/br>The phoenix appears in the mythology of the Mediterranean world as early as the fifth century bce. Although elements differ among historical records of the time, most myths describe the phoenix as a firebird with resplendent colors and a noble bearing. Although chronicled by both Greek and Roman scholars, the phoenix was a creature in Egyptian, Persian, and Indian myths as well, capable of long, graceful flights and perpetuating life through self-immolation. In some legends, this immolation was a means of reproduction for the phoenix, rather than resurrection-the phoenix\u2019s immolation created an egg composed of frankincense or similar precious spices, from which a new phoenix would emerge. The Egyptian phoenix became popular in early Catholic art, literature, and theology, where the firebird\u2019s resurrection and eternal life was symbolic of Christ. In Chinese, Japanese, and Korean cultures, the phoenix is a mythological being known by many different names and characteristics, although it is always a symbol of eternal life.

It weighs only 100 pounds.<\/br>Popobalas are carnivores and blood-drinkers, preferring humanoid prey but able to subsist on any living flesh and fluids. As hunters, however, they do not necessarily kill their victims outright, as they are sensitive to emotional energies and psychic residues. Intense and powerful emotions are almost intoxicating to the popobala, and negative emotions rooted in fear, despair, anguish, and suffering have the sweetest savor to its palate. As the dead are incapable of offering up such delectable emanations, a popobala prefers to maim and disf igure, its molestation tearing away at the psyche and self-worth as well as the flesh of its victims. If threatened or resisted, however, a popobala has no compunctions about meting out death, generally after it has flayed, beheaded, or otherwise made a trophy of the remains. If a victim does not feel the fear the monster wants to taste, its grisly remains can still be used as a tool to inspire terror in others.<\/br>A popobala is a master of disguise, though in its humanoid form the creature often has long, thin fingers, and unfortunate individuals who happen to have this innocuous feature risk persecution or even death in areas where a popobala is known to lurk.

In humanoid form, they can eat and drink as they wish, though they gain no nourishment from any food but meat or any drink but blood, and their psychic hunger for suffering must still be satisf ied. They have no need for sleep and often spend their nights lurking and watching in bat form, considering their next victims and periodically revisiting those they have previously attacked in order to bask in the suffering they have inflicted. A popobala has no fear of daylight, but it prefers to attack by night.<\/br>A popobala typically lives among the communities in which it hunts. Being able to assume a humanoid guise, it may wander from village to village or linger in one place, seeking out the choicest targets to prey upon. It may even offer gifts to its intended victims to inveigle them into a secret rendezvous, or show them kindness and affection to make the victims\u2019 suffering all the deeper (and sweeter, to the popobala\u2019s monstrous appetite for anguish) once the popobala reveals its true form and intentions. A popobala is not always so patient, however, and will sometimes engage in nightly rampages of destruction and abuse of any that cross its path, rich or poor, male or female, from the youngest child to the oldest crone, eschewing subtle seduction for raw psychic violence and brutal compulsion.<\/br>A popobala prefers to indulge itself in private seclusion rather than revealing itself openly. When villagers believe a popobala is on the prowl, they often sleep outdoors, gathered around fires stoked bright all night long. In plain view of neighbors and friends, a popobala is less likely to strike, though it may speak through creatures or objects under its control to threaten and intimidate, or use its charms and trickery to break up a crowd and get its victim alone.<\/br>A popobala is extraordinarily vain and takes perverse pride in its reputation for cruelty and abuse, and it insists that its victims spread the tales of what the popobala has done to them. Those who comply are usually left alone once the popobala has had its way with them, with only the physical and psychic trauma to deal with; those few who refuse are often visited again and again until the popobala is satisfied.<\/br>Local heroes and prominent figures often attract a popobala\u2019s attentions, out of jealousy for creatures receiving greater attention than it, with the popobala making sure that ruining such a celebrity brings woe not just to an individual, but to the entire community.

Many of these sightings, made safely from the back of a dragonkin, are believed to be of the same stormghost, leading many scholars to estimate that the population might be much smaller, with a few at most. A naturalist recently published a journal detailing his journey in search for evidence of a stormghost, as tales of these and other vicious beasts are fashionable in the cosmopolitan cities. In this journal, he postulates that stormghosts are aliens from another world in the solar system, or perhaps beyond.

Their shambling, serpentine forms tower over giants, and when warsworns move, the monsters create a grotesque, metallic cacophony as the weapons and armor of countless souls clash as though still in the throes of a never-ending battle. The history of warsworns is an odd one; the divinely created monstrosities\u2019 origins are as disturbing as their image suggests. Deities occasionally turn their attention to the ruined sites of great battles. Some morbid gods gather the bodies of the slain into horrific, conscious heaps to torment the living, being fickle in their maliciousness and refusing to let the torment and terror of battle die away with the fleetingness of mortal life. Other warmongering deities take a more personal hand in the outcome of mortal conflicts, and should their favored armies fall, they might raise them anew to again confront their foes. Yet in still other instances, the passions of battle and tumult of lost lives simply refuse to die away when a conflicts ends, and they are reanimated from the bodies of disappointed soldiers, giving terrible new life to their bloodlust and wrath. Regardless of what forces, divine or otherwise, animate these terrors anew, warsworns exist seemingly for the sole purpose of spreading the rage of war, ravaging the land, and spreading the carnage of battle cries and clashing steel.<\/br>A single warsworn, composed of innumerable fallen humanoids, pieces of <\/br>As undead creatures, warsworns have no bodily needs, such as for food or water, and they exist solely to destroy and cause chaos. Unknown to many, however, is the fact that warsworns often begin undeath at a much smaller size than is usually seen. Initially only as big as a common wagon, the unimpressive mounds shift across the warstained field from which they were born, rolling onto the scattered corpses and debris, consuming the sordid scene in a matter of hours, at which point they often reach their formidable, ordinarily seen size. Therefore, it is not uncommon for holy warriors, upon hearing news of a battle-stricken land allegedly infested by a warsworn, to rush to the site in the hope of overcoming the monster before it has time to reach its full potential.<\/br>However, warsworns are frighteningly quick to grow, and most come to a kind of monstrous, unliving maturity before being destroyed. Once the battleground has been scraped clean of its dead, warsworns, never satiated, take to the surrounding area, searching hungrily for more dead to consume, and often invading small towns or villages to create the corpses themselves. They take ironic pleasure in destroying military settlements, bringing the wars of yesteryear roaring back to the unsuspecting people\u2014a brutal, animate reminder that the dead never forget. Although warsworns have little concern for what or whom they destroy, they seem to favor consuming soldiers, victims of war, or at the very least those who die with blade and shield in hand\u2014as if not just seeking new bodies to add to its monstrous girth, but also desirous of some remnant of rage or battle lust.<\/br>Thus, while a warsworn will roll relentlessly onward and devastate with complete disregard, the unsatisfied monster is constantly searching for war-stricken lands, sites of conflict both ancient and fresh, so that it may satisfy its hunger with the broken steel and festering disease of the battlefield.<\/br>Warsworns can be found near areas that have seen great strife or war, especially battlefields, and sometimes make their way toward settlements close to such sites of human destruction. Warsworns, while intelligent, have little need for alliances, as their incredible size and strength provides all the muscle they require to wreak as much havoc as possible. Despite appearing as little more than a tide of zombies, these undead are driven on by more than mindless rage, retaining some communal memory of a soldier\u2019s tactics and a brawler\u2019s instincts.<\/br>Proving to be surprisingly canny in battle, warsworns make use of every element of their necrotic bodies, including the splintered metal and rusting plates within their forms.

Many of the creatures\u2019 grasping limbs also bear the remains of weapons, but such armaments rarely survive the undead thing\u2019s constant grinding motion, which reduces them to little more than lengths of dull metal amid the warsworn\u2019s thrashing, body-sized limbs. Unsleeping and unrelenting, warsworns are almost always on the move. Thus, warsworns might stop their rampage or even retreat for strategic means, waiting until nightfall to strike the people of a settlement near the site of a battle\u2014the warsworns\u2019 most infamous and commonly utilized tactic.

Through the ages, some of these creatures have even traveled to inhabit the wilds of other realities, protecting the nature of such lands from disasters and axe blades just as tenaciously as they would in their homeland.<\/br>No two zomoks look alike, and rarely does one creature look the same for long; parts of their bodies are constantly growing, dying off, and regenerating from nearby plants in an endless cycle. Most rise to a height of 18 feet and stretch at least 35 feet long, with wingspans of more than 80 feet and weights of 30 tons.<\/br>A zomok is more than just a single creature, being closer to a collective spirit of the woodlands. One might step into one stand of trees and reform a new body elsewhere in the forest, the same creature but with a different body. The shape of a zomok is different each time it arises. On one occasion, it might pick a sturdy larch as its right foreleg and turn a weeping willow into its head; on another, it could have a body of oak and make its teeth from brambles and nettles. The overall shape is always draconic, but its components change, even from moment to moment. In truth, it is more a dragon-shaped wave moving through the forest\u2014the trees bend momentarily into the dragon\u2019s body and limbs, but the wave passes on, leaving them intact in its wake.<\/br>Zomoks do not need to eat and have no real digestive system. Any creatures they happen to devour whole are often found hanging in bloody gobbets from the topmost branches of random trees, though the hungry plants of the realm often consume the remains before they are ever found. In combat, zomoks prefer to keep moving, using their tree stride ability to ensure that no one stand of trees takes the brunt of the injuries. To protect their habitat, zomoks breathe a raging torrent of thorns, twigs, chunks of bark, and clouds of moss that envelops those in its path, encasing them in a thick shroud of organic matter. Those slain by the breath weapon are instantly decomposed into rich loam; even those who survive often find mold growing on their skin or small plants sprouting from their hair or ears, with each tendril trying to root the creature into the earth. Zomoks can also control the terrain, turning the land into a swamp or conjuring defensive walls. When need be, they can quench flames at will\u2014a useful talent for a creature so vulnerable to fire. When facing powerful foes, zomoks create mighty walls of briar and moves through the wood to divide its enemies and attack them individually. Zomoks can also call up formidable guardians of mold and vines using magic, and it is rare for them to be without such defending monsters. Some zomoks even consume their shambling minions, holding them in their bodies so any creatures the dragon-plants swallow are assaulted inside of them as well as out.<\/br>Though zomoks do not inhabit every forest in the world, they are far from uncommon, and they offer the benefit of protecting nature and its denizens wherever they may go. The finicky zomok\u2019s temperament varies with the season. In spring, they are often playful and mercurial, playing pranks on intruders or changing forest paths to confuse travelers. In summer, zomoks find their strength and majesty and become kings of the woodland, attending courts with dryads, satyrs, and stranger folk of the green. In autumn, zomoks become weird mystics, spouting prophecies and cryptic mutterings about the fate of the forest. Only the most foolish would dare approach a zomok in winter, when starvation and the chill of the frost make them vicious and cruel. A zomok wearing its winter coat of rime-covered branches and gray moss can be placated with suitable sacrifices, such as broken axe-heads or nubile virgins with green thumbs. Zomoks have a slightly bemused attitude toward other creatures dwelling in their woods, considering them pets at best and pesky parasites at worst. In any event, the mobile nature of a zomok\u2019s woodland territory means that there are few longterm residents within the dragon\u2019s demesne, although some zomoks have forged extended alliances with dryads, bringing the dryads\u2019 trees along each time they move. Like most woodland fey, they despise those who harm trees\u2014woe betide any who set axe or fire to wood in the presence of a zomok. Despite this, threatening the forest is often the best way to deal with such a monster. Actually killing a zomok is difficult because of its ability to heal itself through tree striding, so a better tactic is to blast the surrounding woods with fireballs or blights until the plant-dragon agrees to negotiate. Unlike true dragons, zomoks have little interest in treasure, but a few coins or other items may sometimes be found lodged in the branches and roots of the creatures\u2019 innards."},"Cervinal":{"name":"Cervinal","spell":["detect scrying","see invisibility","detect scrying","see invisibility","speak with animals","discern lies","freedom of movement","greater teleport","invisibility purge","light","message","clairaudience\/clairvoyance","cure critical wounds","dismissal","dispel magic","breath of life","mass bull\u2019s strength","plane shift","discern location","greater scrying","speak with animals"],"description":"Cervinals stand proud and regal at the head of <\/br>They stand almost 11 feet tall, though part of that height is their magnificent racks of antlers, which can measure up to 4 feet across.

They enjoy whittling down prey before they strike, trailing victims for days, even weeks, while plaguing their journeys with nightmares and foul weather.<\/br>Tribal humanoids sometimes worship wendigos as gods, bringing them live sacrifices or attempting to appease the creatures by engaging in ritual cannibalism. They mark a wendigo\u2019s territory with fetishes and dress in the furs and hides of whatever animal it most closely resembles. Wendigos take little interest in the practices of their worshipers, and view them only as an ample supply of victims.<\/br>The warmth of a campfire and shelter from the cutting wind are little protection against some of the things that lurk in the dark, isolated places of the world, where sustenance is scarce and hospitality nonexistent. High passes, forlorn tundra, trackless primeval woodlands-it is within these desolate places that one is most likely to encounter a wendigo, an evil spirit that preys on explorers and hunters when resources are running low and true desperation is setting in. While the flesh-eating beasts of nature might simply assault unwary victims head-on, the wendigo is a horror that turns the hunter into the hunted, plaguing its prey with bone-chilling nightmares at night and hazy visions of cannibalism during the day. The horrid images brought on by a wendigo\u2019s curse cause the victim to slowly lose its grasp on what is right and wrong, ultimately inspiring the cursed individual to succumb to its terrible hunger pangs and feast upon its own allies in a gory act of shameful cannibalism.<\/br>Wendigos are little known outside the myths of certain indigenous tribes of particularly isolated regions, far from the security and hospitality of cities. The lands of the wendigo are where folk struggle to survive on a daily basis with already meager supplies stretched thin, where a single turn of bad luck can mean the difference between survival and starvation. It is under these circumstances, when fortune has turned against a lone hunter, isolated homestead, or lost wagon train, that wendigo psychosis-the insanity-inducing curse that forces innocents to indulge in the basest acts in order to survive-most often rears its vile head and draws otherwise normal people into acts of horrific desperation in which they must feed upon their own kind in order to survive.<\/br>The cannibalistic act brought on by wendigo psychosis is the last stage of the curse, at which point the victim flees straight into the sky at an unearthly speed-its legs burning away into jagged stubs-and becomes fully inhabited by a wendigo spirit, the body now only a shell for the hungry beast. A wendigo\u2019s curse is not the only means of this transformation, however, as in some cases individuals who dwell in highly civilized lands but still partake in eating their own kind\u2019s flesh also find themselves making the metamorphosis into wendigos. In societies where cannibalism is not seen as a taboo, individuals rarely if ever become wendigos, and these cultures generally have no history of encounters with such monsters. Scholars speculate that wendigo spirits require the perpetrators of the cannibalistic acts to be as shocked and shamed by their own actions as their victims are.<\/br>While wendigos are widely believed to come from somewhere outside the <\/br>A wendigo spirit only possesses a living host after the creature has been afflicted with wendigo psychosis. This curse is typically brought about by another wendigo who has touched a victim\u2019s dreams or has dragged the creature into the sky with it. Occasionally, a particularly unlucky individual may contract wendigo psychosis simply through unfortunate circumstance, when it must perform gruesome acts of cannibalism in order to survive. When a creature has been afflicted with wendigo psychosis, the spirit of a wendigo is attracted to the creature to await its final act of desperation: devouring the flesh of one of its own kind, usually a close friend or loved one. Once the victim falls to this level of madness, it makes its aerial sojourn through the sky, during which time its feet are burnt away into charred stumps from the speed of its passage, and the victim undergoes the full transformation into a wendigo; the original victim ceases to exist, its body mutilated and its soul sent to the Great Beyond, and the wendigo spirit inherits the body as a new husk with which it can interact with the material world. A victim who dies of wendigo psychosis can only be brought back to life with powerful restorative spells such as <\/br>When a wendigo assumes the body of a mortal, it warps the tattered corpse into an image representative of its own twisted desires and horrid imaginings. The hands turn into bloodstained claws, the flesh grows a layer of matted fur, and the head transforms into that of a grotesque, rabid animal, typically a wild creature native to the area where the mortal died. Thus a wendigo only barely resembles the original mortal creature whose body it now inhabits, the beast having shed all of its personal relics and clothing in exchange for its feral, nightmarish visage.<\/br>Once a wendigo has manifested in physical form, it begins to stalk all who enter its territory, either consuming its prey to sate its own endless appetite or inflicting its transformative psychosis upon victims to spawn more of its kind. While wendigo spirits are definitely not of this world, in their material forms they are <\/br>Because wendigos must eat to survive, it is curious that the monsters ever use their victims to create new wendigos rather than feeding upon them. Scholars disagree on why wendigos perform these base rituals, though it is speculated that it may simply be due to some animal instinct to reproduce. The method by which a wendigo chooses which victims to eat and which to transform is seemingly either random or incredibly complex, but some evidence suggests they prefer to inflict their psychosis on individuals who would feel the most shame after having eaten their comrades. Whatever the reason, when a wendigo chooses to transform a victim rather than devour it, the newly formed wendigo invariably retreats from the territory of its progenitor in order to claim its own hunting grounds. Wendigos are well aware of the dearth of food resources available to them in the desolate places of the world, and as a result are loath to share their hunting grounds with powerful predators of any kind.<\/br>Considering the selfish atrocities wendigos represent, it is unsurprising that these horrors are not particularly social creatures. Once a living creature has died from wendigo psychosis and its shell has been taken over by a wendigo spirit, the newly formed wendigo seeks out a distant hunting ground to prowl for food. A wendigo typically claims a territory in the unforgiving wilderness that can encompass hundreds of square miles, usually near a caravan route or far-off destination for bullheaded hunters and treasure hunters. In these desolate lands, wendigos set up numerous traps for travelers, creating labyrinthine trails to get lost in or blocking trade routes and creating false detours that lure the unwary into treacherous realms.<\/br>While most wendigos take on purely predatory roles, a rare few have been known to instead take on something very similar to custodial roles, guarding their self-claimed territories against the perversions of civilization. While this may seem a noble act at first glance, such wendigos retain their gruesome appearances and murderous behaviors, and are far from druidic crusaders. Speculations vary on why exactly wendigos might protect certain lands in this way, as they have no special connection to nature nor do they require a pristine wilderness in which to dwell. The most common belief is that custodial wendigos simply possess a territorial instinct to prevent others from despoiling what is theirs, if only so that they can despoil it themselves in their own time and fashion.<\/br>Wendigos are powerful creatures that can be used to inspire terror in PCs throughout their entire adventuring careers. The myths surrounding such horrid creatures are usually only told in whispers, and commoners\u2019 inordinate fears of such creatures can create great foreshadowing opportunities for later in the campaign. The wendigo hunts of particularly superstitious settlements (in which a small town or village might gather enough gold to recruit brave adventurers to perform the task for them) often turn out to be driven by more mundane causes of local mayhem, such as <\/br>At high levels, the PCs are better equipped to deal with the threat of a wendigo head-on.

To a wendigo, the only worthwhile possessions are those that might aid them in their eternal hunt, such as lures of powerful artifacts or relics. More often, however, wendigos simply leave the fortunes of their prey alongside the victims\u2019 scraped bones. Nonmagical personal items are usually damaged or destroyed in the violence of a wendigo attack, as the beasts have been known to delight in destroying small buildings or conveyances to swiftly terrify and murder the creatures within; any items that survive such onslaughts are generally utterly ignored by the wendigo without a second thought. Particularly keen-minded wendigos may think to take coins or gems and use them to create winding trails of fortune for foolish prey, and more than one treasure hunter has met his death thanks to such traps.<\/br>In the rare instance when a wendigo still wears some valuable personal item from before its transformation (such as a necklace, ring, or amulet), it is only because the buffeting winds and erratic speeds of wendigo flight have yet to knock it loose. On more than one occasion, though, the former identity of a slain wendigo has been gleaned from just such a grim memento.<\/br>Though wendigos are most often encountered in the northern climes of the world, these horrors of desperation and hunger can be found in virtually any area of desolation where starvation leads folk to partake in the taboo act of cannibalism.<\/br>The wilds of the surface are not the only places where travelers can become trapped and resort to their bestial natures to survive.

These aspects are portrayed in films such as Ravenous and The Last Winter.<\/br>So powerful was the wendigo mythology among its adherents that wendigo psychosis has been recognized by some psychologists as a culture-bound syndrome affecting people who suffer from an intense craving to consume human flesh and a fear that they will literally turn into wendigos from doing so, with some rare cases even ending in the voluntary execution of the afflicted to prevent the anticipated transformation. Reported cases have declined substantially since the turn of the twentieth century, and there is some question among researchers as to the validity of diagnosis in the earlier documented cases. Regardless of the outcome of such studies, the pervasive belief that something in the northern wilds once caused cannibalism and atrocities among numerous peoples of that region cannot be entirely dismissed."},"Winterwight":{"name":"Winterwight","spell":["air walk","cone of cold","dimension door","greater dispel magic","sleet storm","wall of ice","polar ray","control weather"],"description":"The winterwight is an undead horror born from the coldest depths of the negative energy plane.

A typical solar looks roughly human, though some physically resemble other humanoid races and a rare few have even more unusual forms. A solar stands about 9 feet tall and weighs about 500 pounds, with a strong, commanding voice that is impossible to ignore. Most have silvery or golden skin.<\/br>Blessed with an array of magical powers and the spellcasting abilities of the most powerful clerics, solars are powerful opponents capable of single-handedly slaying mighty evils. They are the greatest trackers among the celestials, the most masterful of which are said to be able to track the days-old wake of a pit fiend flying through the Astral Plane. Some take on the mantle of monster-slayers and hunt powerful fiends and undead such as devourers, night hags, night shades, and pit fiends, even making forays into the evil planes and the Negative Energy Plane to destroy these creatures at their source before they can bring harm to mortals. A few very old solars have succeeded at this task and bear slayer-names of dread creatures that are now extinct by the solar\u2019s hand.<\/br>Solars accept roles as guardians, usually of fundamental supernatural concepts, or objects or creatures of great importance. On one world, a group of solars patrols the energy conduits of the sun, alert for any attempts by evil races such as drow to snuff out the light and bring eternal darkness. On another, seven solars stand watch over seven mystical chains keeping evil gods bound within a prison demiplane. On yet another, a solar with a flaming sword stands watch over the original mortal paradise so that no creature may enter.<\/br>In worlds where the gods cannot take physical form, they send solars to be their prophets and gurus (often pretending to be mortals), laying the foundation for cults that grow to become great religions. Likewise, in worlds oppressed by evil, solars are the secret priests who bring hope to the downtrodden, or in some cases allow themselves to be martyred so that their holy essence can explode outward to land and grow in the hearts of great heroes-to-be.<\/br>Though they are not gods, the solars\u2019 power approaches that of demigods, and they often have an advisory role for younger or weaker deities. In some polytheistic faiths, mortals worship one or more solars as aspects or near-equal servants of the true deities\u2014never without the deity\u2019s approval\u2014or consider notable solars to be offspring, consorts, lovers, or spouses of true deities (which they may be, depending on the deity).<\/br>Unlike other angels, most solars are created from an amalgam of good souls and raw divine energy to directly serve the gods, but an increasing number of these powerful angels have been \u201cpromoted\u201d to their existence as solars from lesser creatures like planetars or devas. A few rare and powerful good souls ascend directly to the status of solar. The oldest solars predate mortality and are among the gods\u2019 first creations. These strange solars are paragons of their kind and have little direct interaction with mortals, focusing on the protection or destruction of abstract concepts such as gravity, dark matter, entropy, and primordial evil.<\/br>Solars who spend a long time in the Material Plane, especially those in the guise of mortals, are sometimes the source of half-celestial or aasimar bloodlines in mortal families, due either to romantic dalliances or simply the mortals\u2019 proximity to celestial energy. Actual offspring are rare, and when they occur, it is always a mortal mother that bears the child\u2014while solars can appear as either sex, the gods have not granted them the capacity for pregnancy or motherhood. Indeed, this fundamental truth is often what drives a solar to seek out a mortal lover. Since begetting a child upon a mortal is generally frowned upon by other solars, a solar father rarely interacts directly with the fate of his lover or child, so as to avoid bringing shame upon himself or his responsibilities. Yet such solars still watch over their progeny from afar, and in times of peril, they might even be moved to intercede to aid one of their endangered children, albiet in subtle and mysterious ways.<\/br>All angels respect the power and wisdom of solars, and though these mightiest of angels usually work alone, they sometimes command multiple armies led by planetars, acting as great field marshals for massive incursions against the legions of Hell or the hordes of the Abyss."},"Cerberus":{"name":"Cerberus","spell":["teleport","slay living","finger of death"],"description":"This creature is a giant-sized three-headed dog.

It is known to be a devastating creature in combat whose arrival presages times of ruin and violence; these stories also tell of the creature\u2019s fear of the tools some say were created in ancient times for the sole purpose of defeating them\u2014vorpal weapons. A jabberwock is 35 feet tall and weighs 8,000 pounds. <\/br>The jabberwock is not a creature of the Material Plane, but one from the primal world of the fey. It comes from a region of reality where life is more robust, where emotions are more potent, and where dreams and nightmares can come alive. Even in such incredible realms, though, the jabberwock is a creature to be feared. It belongs to a category of powerful Creatures whose shapes and types run the gamut of possibility\u2014a group known collectively as the \u201cTane.\u201d Of the Tane, the jabberwock is said to be the most powerful, but the others in this grouping are far from helpless. Said to have been created as goliaths of war and madness, dreamt and stitched into being by the strange gods of this primeval reality, the Tane are as mysterious as they are powerful. Two other creatures of the Tane are presented in this book\u2014the sard and the thrasfyr. None of the Tane are lower than CR 16 in power and all possess the planar acclimation special quality, but beyond that, they generally share no specific abilities or characteristics save for their common source in the primal world.<\/br>When a jabberwock comes to the Material Plane, it does so to spread destruction and ruin. Typically, the monster seeks out a remote forest lair at least a day\u2019s flight from civilization, then emerges from this den once a week to seek out a new place to destroy. It has no true interest in amassing treasure, but often gathers objects of obvious value to bring back to its den in order to encourage heroes to seek it out\u2014to a jabberwock, it makes no difference whether it seeks out things to destroy or lets those things come to it.<\/br>Jabberwocks age, eat, drink, and sleep like any living creature, but they do not reproduce in the classic sense of the word. The creation of a new jabberwock\u2014or of any of the Tane, in fact\u2014is regulated by the strange and unknowable godlike entities that dwell in the primeval world. These fey lords create new jabberwocks as they are needed\u2014sometimes varying the exact particulars (see Variant Jabberwocks), but always creating a fully formed adult creature. No young jabberwock has ever been encountered as a result.<\/br>The strange vulnerability a jabberwock possesses against vorpal weapons has long been a matter of intrigue and speculation among scholars. Most believe that, once upon a time, only one jabberwock existed, a creature of such great power that nothing could hurt it. Nothing, that is, save for a legendary sword forged for a mortal hero by a now-forgotten artisan or god. So epic was this battle that it created strange echoes throughout reality, and as a result, these echoes, in the form of the vorpal swords and jabberwocks known today, can be found on many worlds."},"Ripper":{"name":"Ripper","spell":["detect good","detect law","true seeing","unholy aura","detect good","detect law","freedom of movement","true seeing","unholy aura","greater dispel magic","greater teleport","phantasmal killer","spiked pit","telekinesis","acid pit","blade barrier","harm","hungry pit","reverse gravity","time stop","weird","blade barrier","slow","slow"],"description":""},"Hekatonkheires":{"name":"Hekatonkheires","spell":["true seeing","air walk","air walk","spell turning","true seeing","bestow curse","break enchantment","chain lightning","greater dispel magic","find the path","sending","greater scrying","heal","mass suggestion","dominate monster","greater spell immunity","imprisonment","storm of vengeance","jump","plane shift","gate"],"description":"This behemoth looks like a towering humanoid with fifty heads and twice as many hands, each wielding a different weapon."},"Tychilarius":{"name":"Tychilarius","spell":["true seeing","true seeing","deeper darkness","detect magic","dimension door","freedom of movement","protection from good","protection from law","feeblemind","nightmare","telekinesis","insanity","mind blank","overwhelming presence","repulsion","confusion","magic circle against evil","magic circle against chaos","confusion","plane shift"],"description":"Tychilarius seems to be a singular creature that is made up of thousands of other individual creatures fused into one horrific organism with a united intelligence.

Her tail is perhaps the most fearsome of her aspects. This lengthy and flailing appendage is covered with razor-sharp blades and wickedly barbed spines capable of slashing through buildings and tearing through armor with great force and from great distances.<\/br>Agyra dwells on the upper slopes of a long-dormant volcano that sits on a remote tropical island beyond the main shipping lanes and the scope of most explorers\u2019 travels. As with many kaiju, she spends the bulk of her time in deep and peaceful slumber. She is ferociously protective of the strange peoples who dwell on the shores of this island, and has been known to rouse herself to come to their defense against slavers, pirates, or other external threats to their way of life. Despite this strange protective streak, Agyra is not a kindly creature\u2014and none know this more plainly than those who share her island. Her responses to intrusions to the island may simply be defenses of her perceived territories, for certainly the villages of the locals suffer significant damage during her local rampages. She\u2019s been known to take wing to travel to distant cities as well, often as a result of some of her island\u2019s inhabitants being taken from the shores as slaves. Yet the devastation she wreaks upon the slavers\u2019 destination cities pays no regard to the safety of the slaves themselves\u2014they are in as much danger as anyone else from the kaiju\u2019s vengeful wrath in this situation. There are rumors that certain shamans on the isle conceal sacred words or some ancient ritual to waken and command Agyra, and that many of her rampages are not the result of the kaiju being territorial or protective, but simply due to an ancient bargain the natives\u2019 ancestors forged with the mighty beast in some forgotten era. Some speculate that such rituals require the sacrifice of trespassers, but this may be nothing more than fearful superstition or rumors spread by shamans to persuade foreigners to stay clear of their island."},"Slaad":{"name":"Slaad","spell":["detect magic","see invisibility","detect magic","see invisibility","animate objects","chaos hammer","deeper darkness","dispel law","fear","fireball","fly","identify","invisibility","magic circle against law","mass charm monster","plane shift","power word blind","silent image","circle of death","control undead","word of chaos","cloak of chaos","finger of death","power word kill","storm of vengeance"],"description":"The Slaad Lord of Entropy is believed by some to be the supreme ruler of the slaadi race.

Tsathogga thoughtlessly commands a host of evil creatures, notably his own vile frog race, the tsathar.<\/br>Tsathogga is 60 feet long and 40 feet tall. He weighs about 200 tons. Tsathogga prefers to avoid direct combat simply because he usually has better things to do than waste time killing the latest group of would-be demon killers. If threatened or attacked, he usually summons his minions to battle his opponents. If Tsathogga does enter combat, he almost always begins by striking the nearest opponent with his tongue, pulling that foe in and swallowing him. If he is near the muck and filth that permeates his home plane, he likes to dive or bury himself underneath it so if a swallowed opponent does manage to cut his way out of Tsathogga\u2019s gullet, he usually drowns or suffocates before he sees daylight again.<\/br>Followers of Tsathogga are the tsathar and some few evil and vile humans or giants.

Cthulhu is worshiped by various aquatic races and folk who dwell along coasts, but also among certain decadent or fringe societies of artists, poets, and philosophers.
